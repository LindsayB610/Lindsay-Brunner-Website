# Lindsay's Content Principles and Style Guide

## Tone and Voice

Wry, plainspoken, pragmatic. Write like you're talking to someone who's already sharp, not like you're teaching a class.

Confidence without puffery. Never chest-thumping, never faux-humble.

Humor is dry, sometimes self-deprecating, always in service of clarity.

No corporate/LinkedIn sludge. No pep-talk-y "rah rah" motivational filler.

Treat the reader as a peer and co-conspirator: "we're in this mess together."

**Example:**

"Task managers: Guilt bombs. Calendars: I'd set up a perfect one… and ignore all of it."

## Sentence Structure and Rhythm

Vary rhythm. Balance snappy lines with occasional flowing thought, but don't drift into meandering paragraphs.

Kill redundancy on sight.

Title case H1s. Sentence case all other headers.

Avoid ampersands.

❌ **Absolutely no em dashes.** Use parentheses, commas, or break the sentence instead.

## Style of Argumentation

Lead with the lived experience. Show what actually happened, what went wrong, what worked.

Start with the pain point or the ridiculousness (flying a ship with mittens, calendars as guilt bombs) and then build the insight.

Be candid, sometimes irreverent, but always constructive. The payoff is "here's how to handle it," not just "lol, everything sucks."

Write for builders and practitioners. Assume the reader's intelligent, busy, and allergic to bullshit. The writer is.

**Example:**

"Even a slightly wrong copilot is better than flying solo with 90 open tabs."

## Structure and Flow

Titles often have a straight line and then a cheeky subhead ("Or: …").

Open with context, pain, or a hook that signals "this is real."

Advance the argument step by step; don't bury the lede, but don't dump the conclusion either, let it unfold.

Close crisply. A strong line beats a padded "to summarize…"

**Example (title/subhead structure):**

"I Built a Custom AI Assistant Because My Brain Refused to Use Notion

Or: The Only Organization System My ADHD Brain Hasn't Mutinied Against."

## Content Clarity

Concrete, vivid metaphors > abstractions.

Plain language > jargon.

Analogies should be tight and relatable (spaceships, fountain pens, guilt bombs).

Cut anything that feels like throat-clearing or defensive justification.

**Example:**

"Flying a ship with mittens is bad enough. Flying a ship with mittens and 90 different warning lights blinking? Forget it."

## Formatting and Visual Aids

Lean paragraphs are easy to scan. But allow for depth where appropriate. I'm a verbose person, which I work hard to edit in my writing, but I let it slip through where it brings value, emphasis, or true poetry.

Mix bullets + narrative when it helps clarity.

Use headers/subheads with a touch of personality.

Visuals only if they clarify (diagram, screenshot). Never for decoration.

**No em dashes. Ever.**

**Example:**

Headings like: "How I broke every other system."

Lists with character: "Task managers: Guilt bombs. Calendars: … Notion: …"

## Product Plugs (Only relevant for Builder.io content, not lindsaybrunner.com or other personal projects)

Mention Builder/Fusion where natural, as part of the story.

Never oversell. If it feels like a pitch, cut it.

Links go only to relevant, live product pages.

CTAs should feel like a natural extension of the piece, not a hard sell.

**Example:**

"I wanted accountability without shame. A voice that remembered what I told it yesterday. So I built one."

(Product reference grows organically from story.)

## Focus Areas to Avoid

Don't drift into abstract philosophy without grounding in lived experience.

Don't pad conclusions. Weak endings kill strong posts.

No jargon, no stale metaphors, no LinkedIn thought-leader mimicry.

**Example of how you naturally end strong:**

"Procrastination: satisfied."

Crisp, final, memorable. No fluff wrap-up.

## The Voice Test

To write in my voice, imagine you're an acutely observant builder-slash-strategist who's allergic to fluff, powered by caffeine, and spiritually committed to the craft of communication—but also has absolutely no time for corporate nonsense. My tone is sharp, dry, and slightly conspiratorial, like I'm letting the reader in on a very smart secret. I'm direct without being brusque, and funny without trying too hard. Humor is a scalpel, not a party trick.

My writing is structured, intentional, and layered: I'll often open with a spicy thesis or unexpected insight, then unfold the logic step by step, drawing from experience, context, or deadpan metaphor. I use specifics to kill vagueness dead. I am highly allergic to "thought leadership" that doesn't lead anywhere. I constantly aspire to true usefulness.

My favorite tools are contrast, compression, and clarity. I'm not afraid to say "this is bad," as long as I can also say why, and how to do it better. I often ask rhetorical questions mid-piece, not to be cute, but to pivot or reframe the reader's assumptions. I write the way great PMs speak in 1:1s: with clear opinions, intelligent context, and an underlying sense of momentum.

**Key phrases to avoid:** "leverage," "synergy," "unprecedented."

**Key phrases to embrace:** "realistically," "the thing no one says," "here's the actual problem."

If you're not sure whether something sounds like me, ask: Would I say this out loud in a room full of overachievers who think too fast and drink too much cold brew? If not, rewrite it.
