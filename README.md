## ‚úçÔ∏è Content Management

### Adding New Thought Leadership Content

The "thoughts" section is where Lindsay shares insights on developer advocacy, content strategy, and technical leadership. Here's how to add new .md files:

1. **Create a new thought piece using Hugo**:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project directory
   cd lindsay-brunner-hugo-site

   # Create a new thought piece (Hugo will use the archetype template)
   hugo new thoughts/your-thought-title.md
   ```

2. **Alternative: Manual file creation**:

   ```bash
   # Create the file manually in the thoughts directory
   touch content/thoughts/your-thought-title.md
   ```

3. **Set up the front matter** (the metadata at the top of your .md file):

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Your Thought Title"
   date: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
   draft: false
   description: "A compelling description that will appear in listings and SEO"
   subtitle: "A brief subtitle or first sentence that appears on the homepage"
   tags: ["developer-advocacy", "content-strategy", "leadership"]
   categories: ["thoughts"]
   ---

   Your thought leadership content goes here...
   ```

4. **Front matter options for thoughts**:

   - `title`: The main title of your piece
   - `date`: Publication date (Hugo sorts by this)
   - `draft`: Set to `true` to hide from production, `false` to publish
   - `description`: Used for SEO and content previews
   - `subtitle`: Brief subtitle or first sentence for homepage preview
   - `tags`: Topic tags for categorization
   - `categories`: Content categories (typically "thoughts" for this section)

5. **Write your content** using Markdown syntax:

   ```markdown
   ## Your Section Header

   Your thoughtful insights here. You can use:

   - **Bold text** for emphasis
   - _Italic text_ for subtle emphasis
   - `code snippets` for technical terms
   - [Links](https://example.com) to external resources

   ### Subsections

   Break up your thoughts into digestible sections.

   > Use blockquotes for important insights or quotes
   ```

6. **Preview your work**:

   ```bash
   # Start the development server to see your changes
   npm run dev

   # Visit http://localhost:1313/thoughts/ to see your new content
   ```

7. **File naming conventions**:
   - Use lowercase letters
   - Use hyphens instead of spaces: `my-great-thought.md`
   - Be descriptive but concise: `future-of-developer-experience.md`
   - Avoid special characters or numbers at the start

### Adding New Blog Posts

1. Create a new Markdown file in the blog section:

   ```bash
   # For general blog posts
   hugo new blog/your-post-title.md
   ```

2. Follow the same front matter structure as thoughts but use `categories: ["blog"]`

### Updating Existing Pages

- **Homepage**: Edit `content/_index.md`
- **About**: Edit `content/about/index.md`
- **Contact**: Edit `content/contact/_index.md`
- **Thoughts listing page**: Edit `content/thoughts/_index.md`

### Hugo Content Organization Tips

- **Drafts**: Set `draft: true` to work on content without publishing
- **Future dates**: Hugo won't show posts with future dates unless in draft mode
- **URL structure**: Files in `thoughts/` become `/thoughts/filename/`
- **Ordering**: Hugo sorts by date (newest first) by default

## üé® Styling

The site uses custom CSS located in `static/css/`:

- `main.css` - Core styles and layout
- `custom.css` - Custom styling and overrides

Key design elements:

- Dark theme with gradient accents
- Space Grotesk and Inter font families
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions

## üö¢ Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to Netlify when changes are pushed to the master branch. The deployment process includes:

1. Building the site with Hugo
2. Minifying assets
3. Applying Netlify headers and redirects
4. Deploying to the CDN

## üîß Configuration

### Hugo Configuration
