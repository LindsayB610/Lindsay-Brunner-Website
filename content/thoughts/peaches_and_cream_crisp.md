Inspired by dinner at a friend's house this past weekend, and some jars of peaches that were slowly expiring in the back of my pantry, I set out to build my own recipe for a peaches and cream crisp.

Let's be clear, I LOVE pie, but I HATE making pie crust. It's too fiddly. I'm a cook, not a baker, I'm just not great at the perfection that baked goods require. Crisp is right up my alley: most of the elements I love about pie, but way more forgiving for a lazy home cook.

This crisp bakes in a deep dish pie pan and layers a stovetop pastry cream and peach slices under a crunchy oat crumble. 

## Snapshot
- **Implements:** deep-dish pie plate, 9 1/2 to 10 inches; heavy bottom pot to make pastry cream; colander to drain peaches; other standard baking gear
- **Oven:** 350 F / 175 C
- **Yield:** 8-10 servings

## Ingredients

### Fruit
- 5 cups canned sliced peaches, very well drained and patted dry
- Optional juice insurance: 2-3 tsp cornstarch (toss with peaches if the slices seem very juicy)

### Pastry-cream custard (about 2 cups / 480 ml)
- 2 cups (480 ml) whole milk
- 4 large egg yolks
- 6 Tbsp (~75 g) granulated sugar
- 4 Tbsp (~32 g) cornstarch (use 5 Tbsp / ~40 g for an extra-firm set)
- Pinch fine salt
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 20 g (1 1/2 Tbsp) unsalted butter
- Optional flavor boosts (choose one):
  - 1 tsp finely grated lemon zest, or
  - Reduce 1/2 cup reserved peach syrup to 2-3 Tbsp and whisk in off-heat; if you do this, reduce sugar by 1-2 Tbsp (12-25 g)

### Crumble topping (scaled for a 9 1/2-10 inch deep-dish)
- 1 1/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (~112 g)
- 7 Tbsp (~0.42 cup) all-purpose flour (~55-56 g)
- 5/8 cup packed light or dark brown sugar (~125 g)
- 1 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp fine salt
- 95 g cold butter, cut in small cubes (~6 2/3 Tbsp)

## Method

1. **Heat the oven; prep a sheet pan.** Heat to 350 F / 175 C with a rack in the center. Set the pie plate on a rimmed sheet pan (just in case).
2. **Mix the crumble, then pre-toast (crispiest result).** Combine oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Cut in the cold butter with fingers or a pastry blender until you have moist, clumpy crumbs. Spread on a parchment-lined sheet and pre-bake 8-10 minutes until just beginning to color. Set aside.
3. **Make the pastry cream.**
   - Heat the milk with half the sugar until steaming (not boiling).
   - In a separate bowl, whisk yolks, the remaining sugar, cornstarch, and pinch of salt until smooth.
   - Temper: slowly whisk the hot milk into the yolk mixture, then return everything to the pot.
   - Cook over medium, whisking constantly, until thick and glossy; let it bubble for 30-60 seconds to fully activate the starch.
   - Off heat, whisk in vanilla and butter (and zest or reduced syrup if using). Aim for classic pastry-cream thickness—it should stand in soft mounds.
4. **Prep the peaches.** Drain in a colander for 10 minutes, then pat dry. Cut large slices into bite-size pieces. If they seem quite wet, toss with the optional 2-3 tsp cornstarch.
5. **Combine and fill.** Fold the peaches into the hot pastry cream. Spoon into the deep-dish pie plate, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) headspace.
6. **Top and bake.** Cover evenly with the pre-toasted crumble. Bake at 350 F until the topping is deep golden and the custard bubbles at the edges—about 22-28 minutes (deeper pans and heavier fills trend toward the longer end).
7. **Set and serve.** Cool on a rack for 30 minutes so the custard firms to a sliceable, spoon-able pastry cream texture. Serve warm or room temp. Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream is excellent here.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Pan size reality check
- This formula (about 5 cups fruit + ~2 cups custard + crumble) is calibrated for 9 1/2-10 inch deep-dish pie plates.
- If the plate is a smaller 9 inch deep-dish (about 6 cups to the rim):
  - Use 4-4 1/2 cups of the peaches (hold back the rest), and/or
  - Make 1 1/2 cups custard instead of 2 cups:
    - 1 1/2 cups milk, 3 yolks, 3 Tbsp cornstarch (3 1/2 Tbsp for firm), 4-5 Tbsp sugar (50-62 g), pinch salt, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 15 g butter.
  - Use the base topping (not the 125%): 1 cup oats (90 g), 1/3 cup flour (45 g), 1/2 cup brown sugar (100 g), 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt, 75 g butter.

### Sweetness tuning
- The written sugar level is balanced for extra-light syrup. If you reduce some syrup and add it to the custard, drop the sugar by 1-2 Tbsp as noted.

### Crispness insurance
- Pre-toasting the crumbs is the single best move for keeping crunch over a creamy filling.
- Draining and patting the peaches dry is the other big win.

### Texture control
- Want a firmer, more sliceable set? Use 5 Tbsp (40 g) cornstarch in the custard or whisk 2 oz (56 g) room-temp cream cheese into the hot pastry cream off heat.
- Prefer softer or saucier? Stick with 4 Tbsp (32 g) cornstarch and skip the cream cheese.

### Make-ahead
- The crumble can be mixed and chilled 24-48 hours ahead; pre-toast right before assembly.
- Pastry cream can be made up to 1 day ahead: press plastic wrap directly on the surface, chill, then re-warm gently on low heat with a splash of milk, whisking smooth, before folding in fruit.

### Storage and reheat
- Refrigerate leftovers, covered, for up to 3 days. Re-crisp the top at 325 F / 165 C for 10-12 minutes; the custard will warm through without breaking.

### Flavor options
- A whisper of almond extract (1/8-1/4 tsp) plays well with peaches.
- Add cardamom (1/8 tsp) with the cinnamon for a cozy bakery vibe.
