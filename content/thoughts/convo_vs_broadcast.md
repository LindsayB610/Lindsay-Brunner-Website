Let’s get something straight: developers are incredibly smart—and incredibly impatient. They're quick to spot marketing fluff and even quicker to bounce if your content wastes their time. Respect that intelligence and impatience, and you'll earn their attention.

While this dynamic isn't unique to developers—it's true for almost any knowledge worker—my own battle scars mostly come from writing content aimed at devs. So let's stick to what I know best.

After years of wrangling developer-focused content at companies like Okta, ngrok, and Builder.io, here's what I've figured out (often painfully): the best developer content isn't a lecture—it's banter. A conversation. An honest-to-goodness interaction.

## The Broadcast Trap

Most dev content feels like yelling random JavaScript functions into the void and hoping for applause—spoiler, the void doesn't clap.

Here’s why broadcasts tank:

- **They don't read the room:** They're too busy shouting into the void to notice whether their audience is even paying attention.
- **They're generic:** "Insert your problem here" won't resonate with devs who are knee-deep in actual, messy code.
- **They're time thieves:** Devs have zero patience for preamble. Give 'em the goods immediately.

I've made these mistakes. Beautiful content calendars, meticulously SEO'd pieces, only to hear crickets. Turns out, developers prefer content that feels more like an engaging conversation—responsive, useful, and maybe even a bit witty—instead of a dry announcement.

Brands like Stripe and Twilio have mastered conversational content by turning their documentation into interactive experiences and directly incorporating feedback from developer communities. This conversational strategy doesn't just increase trust—it significantly boosts adoption.

## Great Content is a Ping-Pong Match

Good developer content isn't a TED talk—it's a late-night chat, complete with tangents, side quests, genuine laughs, and valuable insights.

Think of the difference between:

- **Broadcast:** “Feature X is revolutionary (trust us).”
- **Conversation:** “You know that annoying thing about Y? Yeah, feature X squashes that. Here’s proof, try it out. Still confused? Let’s chat.”

One feels like spam; the other feels like empathy.

Conversational content is deeply useful by design. Developers immediately recognize and reward content that prioritizes solving actual problems quickly over merely being interesting or clever.

## How to Make Your Content Actually Conversational

Here's my cheat sheet for conversations that land:

### 1. Start with Actual Problems

Instead of guessing, dive directly into real developer forums, GitHub issues, and Stack Overflow questions to uncover genuine frustrations. Clearly translating these into your content demonstrates true empathy and understanding.

**Hot take:** Stop pestering devs with surveys about their ‘pain points’—Google knows their secrets better than they do. Chat with your favorite content guru about tools like Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or Semrush to pinpoint exactly what developers are searching for, instantly boosting your content's relevance and usefulness.

### 2. Keep Context Alive

Maintain continuity by referencing previous articles, clearly indicating what's coming next, or providing follow-up resources. Use linked series and interconnected content so developers can easily explore topics deeply or quickly catch up. (Note: I'm not advocating for dependent series—neither your readers nor Google like content that can’t stand alone. Instead, think about gentle nudges to related topics and resources.)

**Bonus tip:** interlinking content not only boosts conversationality but also strengthens SEO—your content marketer will thank you.

### 3. Crowdsource Your Wisdom

Highlight real developer contributions in your content, such as questions answered, issues solved, or ideas adopted. Publicly acknowledging community input fosters deeper trust and encourages more developers to engage actively.

### 4. Be a Person, Not a Bot

Authenticity means admitting when things aren't perfect, celebrating real developer experiences, and using language that's relatable rather than overly polished. Letting your personality show through—complete with occasional self-deprecating humor or behind-the-scenes insights—builds genuine rapport. Think of the most memorable technical talks you've attended—were they flawless, or did the "demo gods" strike, causing something to fail, and you got to watch a human actually human for a while?

**Polish doesn't create engagement; being engaging does.**

### 5. Lower the Barrier to Interaction

Make it easy and clear how developers can interact with you—direct links to community forums, straightforward commenting systems, scheduled AMAs, and visible prompts to reach out. Reducing barriers and showing your openness encourages real dialogue.

Conversational developer content thrives when it's supported by genuine human interactions.

Companies like Stripe, Fly.io, and LaunchDarkly excel precisely because they're present and visible, answering real-time questions, sharing behind-the-scenes insights, and engaging authentically. This consistent human visibility not only boosts trust but also ensures developers feel heard, valued, and actively involved.

## Use AI Thoughtfully: Prompt Well, Add Humanity

Look, AI is a powerful sidekick, but let's be real—it's never stayed up till 2 AM fixing a broken deployment. That's why I lean hard on DevRel, who have.

Emerging strategies—like personalized AI-driven content that adapts dynamically to individual developer needs—represent huge opportunities to further enhance conversational content strategies.

## The Constant Usefulness Check

Throughout the entire content planning process—from ideation and outlining through drafting and final review—I continuously ask:

> “Does this immediately help someone do their job better, or is it just fancy filler?”

By repeatedly checking for genuine usefulness at every stage, you ensure the end result is focused, valuable, and genuinely beneficial to your audience. If it's filler, drop it early and refine until you hit real utility.

## Time to Ditch the Megaphone

Treat developers as the smart, skeptical humans they are—ditch the megaphone, start the conversation, and maybe they'll stop muting your brand. Remember, broadcasting is one-way information delivery—generic, passive, and often ignored—while conversing is two-way engagement, responsive, useful, and interactive. Aim to create content that feels conversational, earning trust, attention, and real engagement.
