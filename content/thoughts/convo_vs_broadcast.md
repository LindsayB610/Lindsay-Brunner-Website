_Or: Why developer content that listens is way better than content that just talks_

I've been doing developer marketing for almost a decade now, and one of the very first things I learned, which still proves itself true every day, is that developers are incredibly smart, and incredibly impatient. They're quick to spot marketing fluff and even quicker to bounce if your content wastes their time. Respect that intelligence and impatience, reward their time with usefulness, and you'll earn their attention.

While this dynamic isn't unique to developers (it's true for almost any knowledge worker) dev content is what I know best, so let's focus there.

After years of wrangling developer-focused content at companies like Okta, ngrok, and Builder.io, here's what I've figured out about how to achieve usefulness, and engagement: the best developer content isn't a lecture, it's banter. It's conversational. It reads as real human-to-human connection. (As an aside, this is also why I'm not worried about AI eating my job. If there's one thing AI sucks at, it's mimicking humanity. The uncanny valley is real.)

## The Broadcast Trap

So much dev content I read feels like yelling random JavaScript functions into the void and hoping for applause. Spoiler: the void doesn't clap.

Here's why broadcasts tank:

- **They don't read the room:** They're too busy telling you the thing they want to say to notice whether their audience is even paying attention. Have you ever had a conversation with someone who's truly and deeply self-absorbed? A conversation where you could tell that instead of listening to you they're thinking about the next thing they want to say? Yeah, don't write content like that... Consider what your reader might be thinking as they experience your piece.
- **They're generic:** "Insert your problem here" won't resonate with devs who are knee-deep in actual, messy code. You don't have to invent an incredibly involved sample app, just bring in some real life. Show your reader that you understand that their codebase will have all the problems of something that's lived and breathed with multiple developers adding to it, and let's be honest, fucking it up. 
- **They're time thieves:** Devs have zero patience for preamble. Give 'em the goods immediately. You'll hear me say this a lot because it's important: Just be useful.

Good developer content isn't a lecture, it's a late-night chat, complete with tangents, side quests, genuine laughs, and valuable insights.

Think of the difference between:

- **Broadcast:** "Feature X is revolutionary (trust us)."
- **Conversation:** "You know that annoying thing about Y? Yeah, feature X squashes that. Here's proof, try it out. Still confused? Let's chat."

One feels like spam; the other feels like empathy.

Conversational content is deeply useful by design. Developers immediately recognize and reward content that prioritizes solving actual problems quickly over merely being interesting or clever.

## How to Make Your Content Actually Conversational

Here's my cheat sheet for conversations that land:

### 1. Start with Actual Problems

Instead of guessing, dive directly into real developer forums, GitHub issues, and Stack Overflow questions to uncover genuine frustrations. Clearly translating these into your content demonstrates true empathy and understanding.

**Hot take:** Stop pestering devs with surveys about their 'pain points'. Google knows their secrets better than they do. Chat with your favorite content guru about tools like Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or Semrush. You'll make their day, AND pinpoint exactly what developers are searching for, instantly boosting your content's relevance and usefulness.

### 2. Keep Context Alive

Maintain continuity by referencing previous articles, clearly indicating what's coming next, or providing follow-up resources. Use linked series and interconnected content so developers can easily explore topics deeply or quickly catch up. (Note: I'm not advocating for content series where every post replies on a reader having read and potentially completed tutorial steps from the previous. Neither your readers nor Google like content that can't stand alone. Instead, think about gentle nudges to related topics and resources.)

**Bonus tip:** interlinking content not only boosts conversationality but also strengthens SEO. Your content marketer will thank you.

### 3. Crowdsource Your Wisdom

Highlight real developer contributions in your content, such as questions answered, issues solved, or ideas adopted. Publicly acknowledging community input fosters deeper trust and encourages more developers to engage actively.

### 4. Be a Person, Not a Bot

Authenticity means admitting when things aren't perfect, celebrating real developer experiences, and using language that's relatable rather than overly polished. Letting your personality show through, complete with occasional self-deprecating humor or behind-the-scenes insights, builds genuine rapport. Think of the most memorable technical talks you've attended. Were they flawless, or did the "demo gods" strike, causing something to fail, and you got to watch a human actually human for a while?

**Polish doesn't create engagement; being engaging does.**

### 5. Lower the Barrier to Interaction

Make it easy and clear how developers can interact with you: direct links to community forums, straightforward commenting systems, scheduled AMAs, and visible prompts to reach out. Reducing barriers and showing your openness encourages real dialogue.

Conversational developer content thrives when it's supported by genuine human interactions.

Companies like Stripe, Fly.io, and LaunchDarkly excel precisely because they're present and visible, answering real-time questions, sharing behind-the-scenes insights, and engaging authentically. This consistent human visibility not only boosts trust but also ensures developers feel heard, valued, and actively involved.

## The Constant Usefulness Check

Throughout the entire content planning process, from ideation and outlining through drafting and final review, I continuously ask:

> "Does this immediately help someone do their job better, or is it just fancy filler?"

By repeatedly checking for genuine usefulness at every stage, you ensure the end result is focused, valuable, and genuinely beneficial to your audience. If it's filler, drop it early and refine until you hit real utility.

## Time to Ditch the Megaphone

Treat developers as the smart, skeptical humans they are. Ditch the megaphone, start the conversation, and maybe they'll stop muting your brand. Remember, broadcasting is one-way information, delivery. Generic, passive, and often ignored, while conversing is two-way engagement, responsive, useful, and interactive. Aim to create content that feels conversational, earning trust, attention, and real engagement.
