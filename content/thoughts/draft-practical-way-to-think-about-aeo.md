AEO is having a moment, which means two things are now true. It matters, and we are about to drown in content that confidently explains it while quietly missing the point.

Most explanations start with mechanics. Answer engines do this. Search is changing. Optimize for answers, not keywords. Then they hand you a checklist and call it strategy.

Here's the actual problem. Search told us what people typed. Answer engines try to infer what people *mean*. Most content teams are still writing for the first thing while telling themselves they are doing the second.

So the goal is not to "do AEO." The goal is to get better at extracting the real question, then answering that question clearly enough that someone feels relief when they read it.

That's the whole sport.

And inconveniently, this has very little to do with tools.

Most teams do not have an automation problem. They have a judgment problem. Which is annoying, because you cannot subscribe your way out of it.

## The Mental Model I Keep Coming Back To

I think about AEO as three stacked layers, but the important part is what *changes* as you move up them.

At the bottom is explicit demand. This is what people know how to ask for. Keywords, volumes, SERP structure, FAQs, the visible shape of curiosity. Traditional SEO tools are excellent at this layer because they show you patterns at scale. Tools like [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) or even plain SERP analysis tell you what exists and how often it shows up. This layer answers "what is this?" and "how does it work?"

Most content never leaves this floor.

Above that is implicit intent. This is what people mean but cannot phrase cleanly. Confusion, tradeoffs, anxiety, decision pressure, the quiet "am I about to waste my time?" sitting underneath a reasonable query. This is the layer answer engines are trying to satisfy, and where AEO actually starts to matter.

You can surface this layer by reading between the lines of SERPs, but language models are especially good at it. Used well, an LLM can act as a mirror that reflects the unspoken questions people tend to carry when they search. Used poorly, it just writes a blog post you did not need.

The third layer is the one people struggle to describe, because it is not information. It is orientation.

Judgment and point of view show up when a reader stops scrolling and thinks, "Okay. This person has seen how this plays out."

It sounds like someone saying, "This works until about here, then it breaks." Or, "If this feels harder than advertised, that's not because you're bad at it." Or, "Everyone repeats this advice, but they leave out the part that actually causes problems."

The third layer is experience made legible. It does not give the reader more facts. It helps them decide what to believe, what to prioritize, and what to ignore.

That is the layer answer engines are quietly trying to surface. It is also the layer most teams never intentionally write toward.

## Start by Defining What You Actually Care About

Before you think about posts, define a small number of topic buckets that reflect how you think about your work.

Not SEO categories. Not funnel stages. Not the shape of your website navigation.

These buckets should feel like long-running conversations you keep finding yourself in. The things you have strong instincts about. The patterns you have watched repeat. The advice you find yourself qualifying every time you hear it.

This matters because the third layer does not appear randomly. It shows up when you keep revisiting the same terrain and refining your take over time. Coherence beats coverage here.

## Stop Brainstorming. Start Asking Better Questions.

Once you have buckets, the work shifts from ideation to interrogation.

Good prompts are not "topics." They are questions that force you to choose a side or explain a tradeoff. They are the questions you already half-argue with in your head when someone asks for "best practices."

If a question can be answered without saying "it depends, and here's why," it probably will not surface the third layer.

This is why generic brainstorming produces content that feels fine but forgettable. It generates answers. It does not generate judgment.

## Use SEO Tools to Find Confusion, Not Direction

SEO tools are still useful. They just should not be in charge.

I use them to spot where confusion clusters. Repeated modifiers like "why," "worth it," or "mistakes." SERPs full of polite listicles that never quite resolve the question they promise to answer. Topic clusters where everyone says the same thing and no one explains the consequences.

Those are not content opportunities because they rank. They are content opportunities because someone is stuck there, circling.

AEO lives in that unresolved space.

## Let LLMs Surface Tension, Not Content

LLMs are extremely good at surfacing what people are worried about but not saying cleanly.

They are not useful as writers in this system. They are useful as mirrors.

When you ask a model what people are really trying to understand about a topic, you are not outsourcing thinking. You are provoking it. You are looking for the places where the model gives you something that feels almost right but misses the point.

That irritation is the signal.

If the model confidently recommends something you know backfires in practice, that gap is the post. If it explains a concept cleanly but ignores the decision pressure around it, that absence is the post.

The third layer often begins as disagreement.

## Where Judgment Actually Enters the Process

This is the step most AEO advice handwaves, because it cannot be automated.

For every idea that survives the earlier steps, you have to decide whether it is something you would defend publicly. Not as a hot take, but as guidance. Whether it is grounded in something you have actually seen go wrong. Whether it would help someone avoid a real mistake, or just sound reasonable in the abstract.

If you stripped the piece down to a single paragraph, would it still orient someone better than they were before.

If not, it is not done.

This is slower than generating more ideas. That is exactly why it works.

## Save Your Reactions, Not the Output

The content is not what the model says. It is your response to it.

Your "yes, but." Your "this advice collapses at scale." Your "this only works if you already have leverage." Those reactions are the third layer trying to surface.

Write those down. Throw the rest away.

## Write Later. On Purpose.

Ideation and writing should not happen together.

Do the thinking. Extract the tension. Then walk away.

Write later, in a clean document, with the explicit goal of helping another smart person decide what to do next. This separation protects voice and prevents that hollow, brainstorm-scented writing that feels unfinished even when it is polished.

## The Thing No One Likes Hearing

AEO is not about writing in a way that AI can summarize.

AEO is about being the person whose answers deserve to be summarized.

Search tools show you what people ask. Language models help you infer what they mean. Judgment is what helps them decide.

That part is slower. It is also the entire point.

Procrastination: even less satisfied.
