I blog primarly about content marketing and developer advocacy, fields I've spent the majority of my career involved with. You'll also catch me sharing opinions on GTM strategy for startups, people management, search engine optimization, and a variety of other topics. 

I'm available for consulting on building a content marketing or developer relations motion in your organization, reach out and let's chat!
