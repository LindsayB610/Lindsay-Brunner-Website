  - "Rotate (and keep going): At ~20–25 minutes, rotate the pan for even browning. Keep baking until the fat is mostly rendered and the bacon is as crisp as you want. For thick-cut bacon, total bake time is usually 30–45 minutes."
  - "Optional crisp finish: If the bacon looks rendered but you want a bit more edge-crunch, bump the oven to 400°F (205°C) for 2–5 minutes. Watch closely here (home cures sometimes have sugar, and sugar is chaotic)."
  - "Rest (don't skip): Lift the rack to let excess fat drip, then transfer bacon to paper towels (or just blot lightly). Let it rest 3–5 minutes. It crisps a little more as it cools."
  - "Save the bacon fat: Carefully pour the drippings into a heatproof jar/bowl. Do not pour it down your sink unless you enjoy plumbing-based side quests."

I love stovetop bacon in theory for its speed, and perceived simplicity. In practice, I find that it's a tiny grease-based weather event that coats your entire kitchen in "breakfast essence." If you regularly make your bacon on the stovetop, I encourage you to join me in oven bacon land. (And I also encourage you to try Dawn PowerShot on your vent hood, because you know it needs it...)

Oven bacon is the calm, grown‑up solution: hands‑off, even rendering, and you don't end up having to Google how to get bacon grease stains out of a t-shirt.

This method is tuned specifically for what I usually have, which is **very thick, hand‑cut, home‑cured bacon** in a **basic American (non‑convection) oven**, using **wire racks on sheet pans**. The key move: a **cold‑oven start at 350°F** so the fat has time to render before the lean goes from "meaty" to "sad and dry." If you're using thinner bacon, just watch the timing, keep the temp the same.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** rimmed sheet pan; wire rack; foil (for sanity); tongs; paper towels; heatproof jar/bowl for bacon fat (optional but highly encouraged)
- **Oven setting:** Cold start, then 350°F (175°C) (optional hot finish at 400°F (205°C))
- **Batch size:** 1 lb thick-cut bacon per sheet pan (don't crowd; use two pans if you need to)

## Ingredients

### The basics

  * 1 lb very thick sliced bacon 

### Optional (but useful)

  * ~¼ cup water, poured into the sheet pan *under* the rack (helps reduce smoking if your drippings run hot)

### To serve (choose your lane)

  * Breakfast plate with eggs
  * BLT or breakfast sandwich
  * Crumbled over salad, baked potatoes, mac and cheese, or "I'm an adult" roasted Brussels sprouts
  * Apply directly to your face while standing over the hot sheet pan

## Method

  1. Rack + foil setup.

Line a rimmed sheet pan with foil. Set your wire rack on top. If you want extra smoke insurance, pour about ¼ cup water into the pan (under the rack).

  2. Lay out the bacon.

Arrange bacon slices on the rack in a single layer. A little touching is fine. Overlapping is not.

  3. Cold-start bake at 350°F.

Put the pan in a **cold oven** (middle rack is best), then set the oven to **350°F (175°C)**.

Start checking at **20 minutes**.

  4. Rotate (and keep going).

At ~20–25 minutes, rotate the pan for even browning. Keep baking until the fat is mostly rendered and the bacon is as crisp as you want.

For thick-cut bacon, total bake time is usually **30–45 minutes**.

  5. Optional crisp finish.

If the bacon looks rendered but you want a bit more edge-crunch, bump the oven to **400°F (205°C) for 2–5 minutes**. Watch closely here (home cures sometimes have sugar, and sugar is chaotic).

  6. Rest (don't skip).

Lift the rack to let excess fat drip, then transfer bacon to paper towels (or just blot lightly). Let it rest **3–5 minutes**. It crisps a little more as it cools.

  7. Save the bacon fat.

Carefully pour the drippings into a heatproof jar/bowl. Do not pour it down your sink unless you enjoy plumbing-based side quests.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why the cold-oven start?

Thick bacon needs time for the fat to melt out. Starting cold and coming up to temp gently means:
  * better rendering (less "chewy white fat")
  * less scorched edges
  * more even crispness

### How to tell it's done

Look for:
  * deep golden/mahogany color
  * fat that's mostly translucent (not opaque white)
  * steady sizzling that looks like hot fat bubbling, not watery foam

### Smoke control

If your oven gets smoky:
  * use foil on the pan (burnt drippings are the smoke engine)
  * add a small splash of water under the rack
  * avoid the 400°F finish until the end (and only if needed)

### If you're cooking two pans

Use two racks in the oven and:
  * rotate each pan front-to-back halfway through
  * swap rack positions halfway through (top ↔ bottom)
  * expect the total time to run a few minutes longer

### Make-ahead bacon (a.k.a. future you says thanks)

Bake until just shy of your ideal crispness, cool, then refrigerate. Re-crisp on a rack in a 350°F oven for a few minutes until hot and snappy.
