A choose-your-own-adventure garlic recipe: low-and-slow avocado oil confit for pure garlic flavor, or oven-roasted garlic in olive oil for a richer, more aromatic result. Both are useful. The difference is intention.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** small lidded oven-safe crock or ramekin; toaster oven or oven
- **Oven setting:** 250°F (120°C) for confit, 250–275°F (120–135°C) for roasted (40–50 minutes)
- **Batch size:** about 1 to 1½ cups garlic oil with cloves
- **Notes:** short-term storage only (see safety note)

## Ingredients

- 20–30 peeled garlic cloves
- 1 to 1½ cups oil (enough to fully submerge garlic)

**Choose your oil based on outcome**

- Avocado oil → neutral, clean, custardy garlic (true confit behavior)
- Olive oil → aromatic, richer, lightly roasted garlic oil
- Kosher salt (optional; finish later rather than salting the oil heavily)

## Method

This recipe has two correct versions. They share the same setup but diverge in oil choice, temperature tolerance, and endpoint.

- Choose avocado oil if you want garlic that disappears into mashed potatoes, purées, or sauces.
- Choose olive oil if you want garlic oil that tastes explicitly like garlic and olive oil.

Neither is better. They do different jobs.

### Method A: Garlic confit in avocado oil

(Soft, pale, sweet, and extremely mellow)

**Best for:** [mashed potatoes](/recipes/2026-02-07/recipe-ultra-concentrated-baked-potato-mashed-potatoes/), soups, sauces, spreads, or anywhere you want garlic flavor without edge.

1. **Set up the garlic**

   Place peeled garlic cloves in a small oven-safe crock. Cover completely with avocado oil. Lid on.

2. **Cook low and slow**

   Heat oven (or toaster oven) to 250°F (120°C). Cook for 40–50 minutes, undisturbed.

3. **Check doneness**

   Garlic should be: fully soft, pale, collapse easily when pressed. No browning. None.

4. **Finish**

   Remove from oven. Leave covered and let cool. Store cloves submerged in oil.

**Result:** Garlic becomes custard-soft and sweet. Oil carries garlic flavor without asserting itself. This is true confit behavior.

### Method B: Roasted garlic olive oil

(Golden, fragrant, assertive)

**Best for:** bread dipping, roasted vegetables, potatoes, pasta, vinaigrettes.

1. **Set up the garlic**

   Place peeled garlic cloves in a small oven-safe crock. Cover completely with olive oil. Lid on (cracked slightly at the end if needed).

2. **Roast gently**

   Heat oven to 250–275°F (120–135°C). Roast for 40–50 minutes.

3. **Watch the color**

   You want: soft garlic, light golden edges, strong aroma. Pull before cloves turn brown.

4. **Finish**

   Remove from oven. Let cool covered. Store cloves submerged in oil.

**Result:** Garlic is still soft but lightly caramelized. Oil is aromatic and assertive. This is roasted garlic in oil, not true confit, and that's the point.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### How to use

- Mash cloves directly into: [mashed potatoes](/recipes/2026-02-07/recipe-ultra-concentrated-baked-potato-mashed-potatoes/), aioli, compound butter
- Use oil for: [potato skins or chips](/recipes/2026-02-10/recipe-potato-skin-chips-garlic-avocado-oil/), roasted vegetables, finishing soups
- Combine cloves + oil for: spreads, pasta bases, sandwich lubrication

### Storage and safety (important, brief)

- Cool completely, then refrigerate.
- Keep garlic fully submerged in oil.
- Use within 5–7 days.
- Do not store at room temperature long-term.

This is a short-life, high-reward ingredient.

### Final note

This recipe exists to make a choice explicit. Avocado oil gives you restraint and purity. Olive oil gives you aroma and character. Both are correct. What matters is knowing which one you're making, and why.
