Sous vide overnight from frozen is exactly what eye of round wants. Eye of round is a lean, well behaved hunk of beef that only turns tender if you refuse to bully it with heat. Sous vide is how you win that standoff.

The quiet truth: eye of round is not trying to be luxurious. It wants to be precise. Sous vide gives you control, salt gives you depth, and the sear gives you drama. The rest is just not getting in its way.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** sous vide circulator and vessel; vacuum sealer or zip-top bag (water displacement method); cast iron or carbon steel pan; paper towels; tongs; cutting board; sharp knife
- **Cooker setting:** Sous vide 131°F (55°C) for medium rare, or 134°F (57°C) for slightly firmer pink; 18–24 hours from frozen
- **Batch size:** depends on roast size (typically 6–10 servings)
- **Notes:** No thawing. Salt and aromatics go in the bag with the frozen roast.

## Ingredients

### For the bag (no thawing)

- 1 eye of round roast, frozen
- Kosher salt: 1 to 1.25% by weight of meat if you want to be precise, or about 1 to 1½ Tsp per lb
- 1 small sprig fresh thyme or rosemary
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- Black pepper (add after cooking, not before)

### For the sear

- Avocado oil or beef tallow (high smoke point)
- Butter (vegan if you must) 
- Optional: Smashed garlic, for basting

## Method

1. **Choose your temperature**

   - 131°F (55°C) for medium rare with a steaklike texture
   - 134°F (57°C) if you want it slightly firmer but still pink

   Frozen adds only a little ramp-up time. The long hold (18–24 hours) is what lets enzymes gently loosen the muscle fibers without drying them out.

2. **Salt is non-negotiable**

   Salt early and decisively. Since the roast is frozen, you do this in the bag. Salt seasons and slightly alters protein structure so the meat holds onto moisture during the long cook. This matters a lot for a cut this lean.

3. **Aromatics, but restrained**

   You want infusion, not pot roast cosplay. Add one small sprig thyme or rosemary and one crushed garlic clove to the bag.

4. **Bag and cook**

   Bag the roast straight from the freezer with salt and aromatics. Seal, drop in the bath, and cook 18 to 24 hours.

5. **Rest and dry before searing**

   Remove from the bag and dry aggressively with paper towels. Let rest uncovered 10 to 15 minutes. Surface moisture is the enemy of browning.

6. **The sear that makes or breaks it**

   Heat a cast iron or carbon steel pan until ripping hot. Add a high smoke point fat (avocado oil or beef tallow). Sear 30 to 45 seconds per side, including the edges. The goal is crust, not more cooking; the interior is already done. Kill the heat, add butter and optional smashed garlic, and baste briefly.

7. **Slice like you mean it**

   Slice thin against the grain. If you cut thick or with the grain, the meat will punish you for it.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why no fat in the bag

Do not put butter or olive oil in the bag. Fat in the bag pulls flavor compounds out of the beef and into the liquid, where you will not eat them. Save fat for the sear. Do not add strong acids or sugary marinades; they do not penetrate deeply and can create odd cured textures over long sous vide times.

### Optional power move

Chill the roast overnight after sous vide, then sear just before dinner. Cold meat browns harder and faster without overshooting the interior. This is how restaurants cheat physics.

### Flavor into a lean cut

Eye of round has almost no internal fat. Flavor comes from seasoning discipline and surface chemistry. Salt does two things: it seasons, and it slightly alters protein structure so the meat holds moisture during the long cook.

- Add black pepper after cooking, not before.
