These pretzels started as a saved Insta reel and turned into one of those quietly essential party snacks (crunchy, savory-forward, lightly sweet, and designed to sit happily next to your cheese board rather than overpower it).

The original inspiration came from an Instagram post by [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://www.instagram.com/sallysbakeblog/), whose honey mustard pretzel recipe is genuinely dangerous in the best way. This version is adapted for cheese boards and grazing: a little less sweet, a little less oily, and split into two mustard paths so you get contrast without complication.

## Ingredients

I tend to split this recipe and make two half-batches (regular Dijon for half and basil Dijon for the other). If you'd like to follow that path, divide each ingredient. If you want just one version, use the full amount of one chosen mustard.

- 12–16 oz hard sourdough pretzels
- 6 Tbsp neutral oil (vegetable or olive)
- 2 Tbsp honey, divided
- 2 Tbsp Dijon mustard
- 2 Tsp ground mustard
- 1½ Tsp onion powder
- ½ Tsp fine salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 200°F (93°C). Line one or two large baking sheets with parchment.
2. Break pretzels into bite-size pieces. Transfer to a very large bowl and divide evenly between two bowls.
3. In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together half of the oil, honey, Dijon mustard, ground mustard, onion powder, and salt until fully emulsified. Pour over the first bowl of pretzels and toss thoroughly.
4. Repeat with the remaining ingredients for the second bowl, following the variation guidance below.
5. Spread pretzels in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet(s). Avoid crowding. Use two sheets if needed.
6. Bake for 50–60 minutes, stirring well every 15 minutes and scraping the pan so nothing scorches.
7. Remove from oven and let cool completely on the pan. They will continue to crisp as they cool.

## Variations

### Classic Dijon

Use a standard smooth Dijon mustard.

This version is savory, sharp, and versatile (the one that disappears first without anyone quite realizing why).

Pairs especially well with:
- Aged cheddar-style cheeses
- Alpine cheeses
- Salami and smoked meats

### Basil Dijon

Use basil Dijon mustard in place of standard Dijon.

Basil reads sweeter once toasted, so keep the honey restrained, you can lower it to 1½ Tbsp. If you want to ground the herbal note, a tiny pinch of black pepper works well.

Pairs especially well with:
- Creamy cheeses
- Onion-forward cheeses
- Soft baguette slices with butter

## Notes and guardrails

- These pretzels should be fully dry and crisp, not glossy or sticky. If they feel tacky once cooled, they need more oven time.
- Cool completely before tasting or adjusting salt. Sugar lies when hot.
- Store uncovered or loosely covered at room temperature for up to 2 days. Best the day they're made.
- If they soften, refresh in a 300°F oven for 5 minutes, then cool again.

## Credit where it's due

This recipe is adapted from a [honey mustard pretzel recipe by Sally's Baking Addiction](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSutYXEjrYP/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), which originally crossed my feed via Instagram and immediately earned a permanent save. If you're looking for the full snack-forward version, hers is absolutely worth making too.
