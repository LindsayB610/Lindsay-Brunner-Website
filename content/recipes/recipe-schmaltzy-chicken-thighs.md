recipeIngredient:
  - "2½–3 lb bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4–5 thighs)"
  - "1½–2 Tbsp chicken schmaltz, melted"
  - "1¼ Tsp kosher salt, divided"
  - "Freshly cracked black pepper"
  - "½ Tsp garlic powder"
  - "½ Tsp onion powder"
  - "½ Tsp paprika (not smoked)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Pat the thighs very dry (if frozen, thaw in cold water first, changing the water once). Season both sides with about ¾ Tsp salt total. Set skin-side up on a plate."
  - "Melt the schmaltz and stir in the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and black pepper. Do not add more salt. Baste the schmaltz mixture over the skin only."
  - "Heat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Heat a 10–12 inch cast iron skillet over medium heat for 2–3 minutes. The pan is ready when the chicken sizzles immediately on contact. Place the thighs skin-side down (do not crowd; use two pans if needed). Cook without moving for 10–14 minutes until the skin is golden and well rendered. This stretch is intentionally long for fat rendering, not quick browning. Leave the rendered fat in the pan for the oven finish (spoon off excess only if it is truly excessive)."
  - "Flip the thighs skin-side up and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast until the chicken reaches 175–185°F (79–85°C) in the thickest part, about 15–22 minutes."
  - "If the skin needs more color, switch to broil for 2–3 minutes and watch closely. Rest the chicken 7–10 minutes. Finish with a light sprinkle of flaky salt and black pepper."

I don't know why everyone was conspiring to hide chicken schmaltz from me, but now that I know it exists, there's no going back. Schmaltz is just rendered chicken fat (usually from skin and trimmings), and it turns out it's the missing piece in every "why isn't this as good as I expected" chicken recipe I've ever made. This recipe is what happens when you stop fighting chicken thighs and let them do what they want: render their fat slowly in a hot cast iron pan, crisp the skin properly, then finish in the oven. No vegetables, no sauce, no distractions. Just schmaltz, thighs, and enough patience to let the pan handle the hard part.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** 10–12 inch cast iron skillet; tongs; plate; optional instant-read thermometer
- **Stove setting:** medium heat for sear (10–14 minutes)
- **Oven setting:** 425°F (220°C) for 15–22 minutes (optional broil 2–3 minutes at the end)
- **Batch size:** 3–4 servings
- **Total time:** about 55–65 minutes (about 10 minutes active)

## Ingredients

- 2½–3 lb bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4–5 thighs)
- 1½–2 Tbsp chicken schmaltz, melted
- 1¼ Tsp kosher salt, divided
- Freshly cracked black pepper
- ½ Tsp garlic powder
- ½ Tsp onion powder
- ½ Tsp paprika (not smoked)

## Method

1. **Early prep**

   Pat the thighs very dry. (If frozen, thaw in cold water first, changing the water once, until pliable.) Season both sides with about ¾ Tsp salt total. Set skin-side up on a plate. Dryness matters more than a long brine here.

2. **Schmaltz seasoning**

   Melt the schmaltz and stir in the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and black pepper. Do not add more salt. Baste the schmaltz mixture over the skin only. Keeping it on the skin (and not under it) lets the fat render properly; excess under the skin interferes with that.

3. **Sear skin-side down**

   Heat the oven to 425°F (220°C) so it is ready when the sear is done. Heat a 10–12 inch cast iron skillet over medium heat for 2–3 minutes. The pan is ready when the chicken sizzles immediately on contact. Place the thighs skin-side down in the pan. Do not crowd; if you have more than 4–5 thighs, use two pans or work in batches. Cook without moving for 10–14 minutes until the skin is golden and well rendered. This stretch is intentionally long for fat rendering, not quick browning. Do not peek or nudge. The skin will release when it is ready. (Seriously.) Leave the rendered fat in the pan for the oven finish; spoon off excess only if it is truly excessive.

4. **Finish in the oven**

   Flip the thighs skin-side up and transfer the skillet to the oven (fat stays in the pan). Roast until the chicken reaches 175–185°F (79–85°C) in the thickest part, about 15–22 minutes.

5. **Optional broil and rest**

   If the skin needs more color or crisp, switch to broil for 2–3 minutes and watch closely. Rest the chicken 7–10 minutes. Finish with a light sprinkle of flaky salt and black pepper. No sauce required.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why this works

A hot cast iron pan gives the skin full contact and steady heat so the fat renders and the skin crisps without burning. Stovetop gets you color and texture; the oven finishes the meat evenly. Schmaltz boosts browning and flavor without the butter smoke show.

Because much of the cooking happens during the stovetop render, the oven finish is shorter than a typical roast. If you skip the stovetop sear, thighs may need 35–45 minutes at 425°F (220°C) from cold.

### Schmaltz

Chicken schmaltz is rendered chicken fat. You can buy it (often in the freezer section at grocery stores or from butchers) or render your own from skin and trimmings. Skin only. Excess under the skin just gets in the way of rendering. No schmaltz? Melted duck fat or a neutral oil works; the flavor will be different.

### Pan size

A 10–12 inch skillet comfortably fits 4–5 thighs. More than that? Use two skillets or sear in batches and combine in one pan for the oven.

### Sheet pan version with potatoes and veg

You can turn this into a one-pan dinner. Same schmaltz-basted thighs, but on a rimmed sheet pan with potatoes and sturdy vegetables. Potato-first logic: toss tiny Yukon Gold or fingerling potatoes with olive oil and salt, spread on the pan, and roast at 425°F (220°C) for 10–15 minutes. Nestle the chicken thighs among the potatoes skin-side up, scatter your veg around them, and roast 35–45 minutes until the chicken hits 175–185°F (79–85°C) and the potatoes are tender. Chicken fat and schmaltz will season everything.

**Potato sizing:** Marble-size potatoes can stay whole. Golf-ball size or bigger? Halve or quarter them or the centers will lag.

**Sturdy veg:** Use vegetables that can take high heat for 20–25 minutes without turning to mush. Good swaps: broccoli florets, Brussels sprouts (halved), bell peppers, cauliflower, green beans, zucchini. Cherry tomatoes: add for the last 10–15 minutes. Sweet potato or butternut squash: cube and add to the mix. Mushrooms: keep them in big pieces so they brown instead of collapsing. Onion: wedges work, or half a bag of frozen pearl onions (no thaw), or a couple of shallots peeled and halved.

Do not overcrowd the pan. If everything is touching, it steams.

- Do not move the chicken during the sear. Let the skin release on its own.
- Do not skip resting. Those 7–10 minutes are when the juices actually redistribute. Worth it.
