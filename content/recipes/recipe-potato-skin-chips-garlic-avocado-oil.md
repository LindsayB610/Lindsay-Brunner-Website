The leftover baked russet potato skins from [Ultra-Concentrated Baked Potato Mashed Potatoes](/recipes/2026-02-07/recipe-ultra-concentrated-baked-potato-mashed-potatoes/) are a goldmine, not waste.

Since the potato flesh has already lost a lot of moisture in the oven and been riced, the skins are already dry, flavorful, and just begging for a crisp finish.

**Why [garlic avocado oil](/recipes/2026-02-10/recipe-garlic-in-oil-confit-roasted/) is ideal here**

- High smoke point: you can push heat without bitter edges.
- Neutral base: garlic reads clean, not muddy.
- Already infused: flavor is in the fat, not sitting on the surface.
- Skins are dry (because baked, not boiled): they crisp instead of steaming.

This is exactly where garlic oil should be loud.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** sheet pan (oven/toaster oven) or air-fryer basket; bowl for tossing
- **Oven setting:** 400–425°F (204–218°C) for 15–25 minutes total, or air-fryer 375–390°F (191–199°C) for 8–12 minutes
- **Batch size:** however many skins you have from the mashed potato recipe

## Ingredients

- Potato skins from [Ultra-Concentrated Baked Potato Mashed Potatoes](/recipes/2026-02-07/recipe-ultra-concentrated-baked-potato-mashed-potatoes/), torn or cut into large pieces
- [Garlic avocado oil](/recipes/2026-02-10/recipe-garlic-in-oil-confit-roasted/), just enough to coat (do not drown them)
- Salt (that’s it for the base)

## Method

1. **Prep the skins**

   Tear or cut the leftover potato skins into large pieces. Put them in a bowl and add just enough garlic avocado oil to coat. Do not add salt yet (salt after they come out, or you risk surface moisture).

2. **Choose your weapon: toaster oven or oven**

   Heat to 400–425°F (204–218°C). Arrange skins skin-side down on a sheet pan in a single layer. Do not crowd; overlapping leads to steamed, sad skins.

   Bake 10–15 minutes, then flip. Give them another 5–10 minutes. Pull when edges are blistered and centers are crisp, not leathery.

3. **Or: air-fryer**

   Set to 375–390°F (191–199°C). Arrange skins in the basket in a single layer. Cook 8–12 minutes total, shaking once halfway. Same doneness cues: blistered edges, crisp centers.

4. **Season and finish**

   Salt after they come out. Add any optional finishers (see Notes) while they’re still hot if you like. No need to add raw garlic; you already solved that upstream.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Seasoning strategy

Salt after they come out, not before, unless you want surface moisture.

Optional finishers (choose one, not all):

- Flaky salt and black pepper
- Parmesan while hot (it will melt and cling). The vegan label applies to the base recipe; Parmesan adds dairy.
- Smoked paprika, very lightly
- Chopped parsley if you want to pretend you’re civilized

### Texture pro tip

If any skins feel thick or stubborn: pull the crispiest ones first. Let the thicker ones go another 3–5 minutes. Do not crowd them; overlapping is how you get sadness.

### Verdict and next steps

Using garlic avocado oil here is not just acceptable, it’s optimal. You’ve concentrated potato flavor, preserved garlic aroma, avoided bitterness, and created a zero-waste side or snack that feels intentional. These will disappear faster than the mashed potatoes.

Next step up the ladder: use them as a garnish on the [mash](/recipes/2026-02-07/recipe-ultra-concentrated-baked-potato-mashed-potatoes/), or as scoops for egg salad or something obscene and good. That oil’s been waiting for this moment.
