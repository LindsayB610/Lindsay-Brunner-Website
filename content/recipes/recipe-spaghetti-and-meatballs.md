  - "Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving"
  - "Parsley, chopped, for serving (optional)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Start the sauce first. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until very soft and translucent, 8 to 12 minutes. You want sweet and mellow, not browned. If using garlic, add it for the last 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant."
  - "Add one of the cans of tomato sauce first (or a portion if you're doing both at once). Stir and let it cook in the oil and onion for 3 to 5 minutes. This is the step that knocks down that raw, tinny edge."
  - "Add the second can of tomato sauce, the whole tomatoes (crush by hand as you add), and the diced tomatoes. Add the whole carrot, Parm rind, and bay leaf if using. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low."
  - "Add a small pinch of salt now, but keep it under-salted at this stage. Sausage and meatballs will add salt later. Simmer partially covered, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes while you make meatballs. Longer is better. 60 to 90 minutes is excellent. If you want it smoother, use an immersion blender for 2 to 3 quick pulses, not a full puree."
  - "Make the panade. Combine bread and milk and let sit 5 minutes. Mash into a thick paste. If it's soupy, squeeze gently. If it's dry, add a splash more milk. If using the bread plus panko option, stir panko in after the bread becomes a paste."
  - "Mix the flavor base. In a large bowl, mix thoroughly: panade, eggs, Parm, parsley, garlic, grated onion/shallot (squeezed dry), pepper, nutmeg, and ¼ Tsp salt."
  - "Add meat and fold gently. Add the beef and both sausages. Fold gently until just combined. Stop early."
  - "Test patty. Cook a small patty and taste. Adjust salt if needed. With sausage, this is non-negotiable."
  - "Shape. Roll into 2-inch meatballs. Lightly packed, not compressed."
  - "Par-bake on a rack. Heat oven to 425°F (218°C). Line sheet pans with foil. Place wire racks on top. Lightly oil the racks. Arrange meatballs with a little space between. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until they are set and lightly browned but not fully cooked through. Optional nerd target: 120 to 130°F (49 to 54°C) internal. You will see a lot of fat on the pan. That's correct."
  - "Make sure the sauce volume matches the batch. Before adding meatballs, look at your pot and ask: If I add all meatballs, will they be mostly submerged without stacking too tightly? If yes, proceed. If it looks tight, open one additional 28 oz can (sauce or whole) and simmer 10 minutes. If it looks crowded or stacked, open two additional 28 oz cans, one at a time, simmering briefly between. No half cans. No measuring cups. Just the pot telling the truth. Also, if your pot can't comfortably hold everything, split sauce into two pots now."
  - "Finish meatballs in the simmering sauce. Bring sauce back to a gentle simmer. Add meatballs in batches if needed so you don't break them. Simmer gently 25 to 40 minutes, partially covered, stirring from the bottom occasionally. Avoid boiling hard."
  - "Optional beef base. After the meatballs have simmered 15 to 20 minutes, taste the sauce. Only if it tastes hollow, dissolve and add ½ Tsp BTB or ½ Knorr pot, taste, then decide if it needs more. Stop before it becomes stew-like."
  - "End adjustments. Remove carrot, Parm rind, bay leaf. Taste and adjust: salt, a small pinch of sugar only if needed (½ Tsp at a time), and if it tastes heavy, add 1 Tsp red wine vinegar or lemon juice."
  - "Cook spaghetti and combine. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until just shy of al dente. Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain. In a large pan or pot, toss pasta with a few ladles of sauce and a splash of pasta water until glossy and well-coated. Serve meatballs on top. Spoon extra sauce over everything. Finish with Parm and parsley."

This is the two sheet pans plus some version. The meatballs are rich (75/25 beef plus sausage), so the method is designed to keep them tender without turning your sauce into an oil slick. The sauce is your family-style flexible tomato blend, with a controlled hint of sweetness.

This is written as a locked-in baseline you can test and edit from.

## Method

1. **Start the sauce first (it wants time)**

   **Sweat the onion**

   Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until very soft and translucent, 8 to 12 minutes. You want sweet and mellow, not browned.

   If using garlic, add it for the last 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant.

   **Add the first tomato layer and cook off the iron**

   Add one of the cans of tomato sauce first (or a portion if you're doing both at once). Stir and let it cook in the oil and onion for 3 to 5 minutes. This is the step that knocks down that raw, tinny edge.

   **Add remaining tomatoes (start with the 6-can base)**

   Add:
   - the second can of tomato sauce
   - the whole tomatoes (crush by hand as you add)
   - the diced tomatoes

   Add the whole carrot, Parm rind, and bay leaf if using.

   Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low.

   **Season lightly and simmer**

   Add a small pinch of salt now, but keep it under-salted at this stage. Sausage and meatballs will add salt later.

   Simmer partially covered, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes while you make meatballs. Longer is better. 60 to 90 minutes is excellent.

   **Sauce texture choice:**

   If you want it smoother, use an immersion blender for 2 to 3 quick pulses, not a full puree.

2. **Make the meatballs**

   **Make the panade**

   Combine bread and milk and let sit 5 minutes. Mash into a thick paste. If it's soupy, squeeze gently. If it's dry, add a splash more milk.

   If using the bread plus panko option, stir panko in after the bread becomes a paste.

   **Mix the flavor base**

   In a large bowl, mix thoroughly:
   - panade
   - eggs
   - Parm
   - parsley
   - garlic
   - grated onion/shallot (squeezed dry)
   - pepper
   - nutmeg
   - ¼ Tsp salt

   **Add meat and fold gently**

   Add the beef and both sausages. Fold gently until just combined. Stop early.

   **Test patty**

   Cook a small patty and taste. Adjust salt if needed. With sausage, this is non-negotiable.

   **Shape**

   Roll into 2-inch meatballs. Lightly packed, not compressed.

3. **Par-bake on a rack (your grease-control step)**

   Heat oven to 425°F (218°C).

   Line sheet pans with foil. Place wire racks on top. Lightly oil the racks.

   Arrange meatballs with a little space between.

   Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until they are set and lightly browned but not fully cooked through. Optional nerd target: 120 to 130°F (49 to 54°C) internal.

   You will see a lot of fat on the pan. That's correct.

4. **Make sure the sauce volume matches the batch (whole cans only)**

   This is where we keep it sane.

   Before adding meatballs, look at your pot and ask:

   "If I add all meatballs, will they be mostly submerged without stacking too tightly?"
   - If yes: proceed.
   - If it looks tight: open one additional 28 oz can (sauce or whole) and simmer 10 minutes.
   - If it looks crowded or stacked: open two additional 28 oz cans, one at a time, simmering briefly between.

   No half cans. No measuring cups. Just the pot telling the truth.

   Also: if your pot can't comfortably hold everything, split sauce into two pots now.

5. **Finish meatballs in the simmering sauce**

   Bring sauce back to a gentle simmer.

   Add meatballs in batches if needed so you don't break them.

   Simmer gently 25 to 40 minutes, partially covered, stirring from the bottom occasionally. Avoid boiling hard.

   **As they simmer:**
   - the meatballs finish cooking
   - the sauce thickens
   - some fat renders into the sauce (good flavor, controlled)

   **Optional: beef base**

   After the meatballs have simmered 15 to 20 minutes, taste the sauce.

   Only if it tastes hollow, dissolve and add:
   - ½ Tsp BTB or ½ Knorr pot, taste, then decide if it needs more

   Stop before it becomes stew-like.

   **End adjustments**

   Remove carrot, Parm rind, bay leaf.

   Taste and adjust:
   - salt
   - a small pinch of sugar only if needed (½ Tsp at a time)
   - if it tastes heavy, add 1 Tsp red wine vinegar or lemon juice

6. **Cook spaghetti and combine intelligently**

   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

   Cook spaghetti until just shy of al dente.

   Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain.

   **The best serving approach**

   In a large pan or pot, toss pasta with a few ladles of sauce and a splash of pasta water until glossy and well-coated.

   Serve meatballs on top. Spoon extra sauce over everything.

   Finish with Parm and parsley.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why this method works for 75/25 beef plus sausage

High-fat meat stays juicy, but can turn greasy. Par-baking on a rack renders excess fat early. Finishing in sauce prevents drying and adds cohesion.

### Oregano rule

A pinch only. Too much equals pizza. You're right.

### Sauce too thick?

Add hot water or pasta water a little at a time. This is tradition, not dilution.

### Sauce too thin?

Simmer uncovered longer. Tomatoes will concentrate.

### Meatballs dense?

Usually overmixing or overpacking. Fold gently, roll lightly.

### Meatballs falling apart?

Usually too-wet panade or onion not squeezed dry. Also, make sure they par-bake long enough to set before saucing.

### Storage and freezer plan

- Meatballs plus sauce keep 4 days refrigerated.
- Freeze meatballs in sauce or separately.
- Reheat gently by simmering, not microwaving into rubber.
