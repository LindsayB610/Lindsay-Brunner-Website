  - "1.5 to 2 lb spaghetti, depending on crowd"
  - "Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving"
  - "Parsley, chopped, for serving (optional)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Start the sauce first. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until very soft and translucent, 8 to 12 minutes. You want sweet and mellow, not browned. Add 1 to 2 Tsp salt here to begin building flavor. Add the garlic for the last 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant."
  - "Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, for several minutes until it deepens to brick red but not burnt. This builds a deeper flavor base."
  - "Add your other tomatoes: 2 (28 oz) cans of tomato sauce, 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes (crush by hand as you add), and 2 (14.5 oz) cans of diced tomatoes. Rinse your 2 cans of sauce with about half a can's worth of water (you can splash back and forth to rinse) then add this sauce water to the pot. Add the whole peeled carrot(s), Parm rind, and bay leaves if using. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low."
  - "Simmer partially covered, stirring occasionally. While it simmers, make the meatballs (step 2). The sauce wants at least 30 minutes total, longer is better. 60 to 90 minutes is excellent."
  - "Pre-heat oven to 425°F (218°C). Make the panade. Combine bread and milk and let sit 5 minutes. Mash into a thick paste. If it's soupy, squeeze gently. If it's dry, add a splash more milk. If using the bread plus panko option, stir panko in after the bread becomes a paste."
  - "Mix the flavor base. In a large bowl, mix thoroughly: panade, eggs, Parm, freeze-dried parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, fennel seed (if using), nutmeg (if using), and 1½ Tsp kosher salt."
  - "Add meat and mix. Add the beef and pork (or veal). Mix until combined. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty."
  - "Test patty. Cook a small patty and taste. Adjust salt, pepper, and other seasoning to your taste."
  - "Shape. Roll into 2-inch meatballs. Lightly packed, not compressed."
  - "Par-bake on a rack. Line sheet pans with foil. Place wire racks on top. Lightly oil the racks. Arrange meatballs with a little space between. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until they are set and lightly browned but not fully cooked through. Optional nerd target: 120 to 130°F (49 to 54°C) internal. You will see a lot of fat on the pan. That's correct."
  - "Make sure the sauce volume matches the batch. Before adding meatballs, look at your pot and ask: If I add all meatballs, will they be mostly submerged without stacking too tightly? If yes, proceed. If it looks tight, open one additional 28 oz can (sauce or whole) and simmer 10 minutes. If it looks crowded or stacked, open two additional 28 oz cans, one at a time, simmering briefly between. No half cans. No measuring cups. Just the pot telling the truth. Also, if your pot can't comfortably hold everything, split sauce into two pots now."
  - "Finish meatballs in the simmering sauce. Bring sauce back to a gentle simmer. Add meatballs in batches if needed so you don't break them. Simmer gently 25 to 40 minutes, partially covered, stirring from the bottom occasionally. Avoid boiling hard."
  - "Optional beef base. After the meatballs have simmered 15 to 20 minutes, taste the sauce. Only if it tastes hollow, dissolve and add ½ Tsp BTB or ½ Knorr pot, taste, then decide if it needs more. Stop before it becomes stew-like."
  - "End adjustments. Remove carrot(s), Parm rind, bay leaves. Taste and adjust: salt, a small pinch of sugar only if needed (½ Tsp at a time), and if it tastes heavy, add 1 Tsp red wine vinegar or lemon juice."
  - "Cook spaghetti and combine. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until just shy of al dente. Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain. In a large pan or pot, toss pasta with a few ladles of sauce and a splash of pasta water until glossy and well-coated. Serve meatballs on top. Spoon extra sauce over everything. Finish with Parm and parsley."

This is my big-batch, two–sheet-pan version of classic spaghetti and meatballs, built for feeding people without stress. The meatballs are a mix of 75/25 beef and ground pork or veal, so the method is designed to keep them tender and flavorful without turning your sauce into an oil slick. You can certainly use leaner beef, I often do, this is just what happened to be in my freezer this week. 

The sauce here is also flexible and family-style, a layered tomato base with just enough natural sweetness to feel balanced, not sugary.

The key move here is separating structure from flavor. The meatballs are par-baked on racks first to set their shape and shed excess fat, then finished gently in the sauce so everything comes together without heaviness. It is a practical, forgiving approach that scales well, freezes well, and tastes like you worked harder than you actually did.

This is not a precious recipe. It is designed to be adjusted by the size of your pot, the appetite of your table, and the truth of what your sauce looks like in the moment. The guardrails are here so you can relax and cook with confidence, not second-guess every step. This recipe makes about 6 quarts of sauce + meatballs for me, plenty to feed my family and my freezer.

## Method

1. **Start the sauce and get it simmering**

   **Sweat the onions**

   Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until very soft and translucent, 8 to 12 minutes. You want sweet and mellow, not browned.

   Add 1 to 2 Tsp salt here to begin building flavor.

   Add the garlic for the last 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant.

   **Add tomato paste and cook until brick red**

   Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, for several minutes until it deepens to brick red. This builds a deeper flavor base.

   **Add your other tomatoes**

   Add 
   - 2 (28 oz) cans of tomato sauce
   - 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes (crush by hand as you add)
   - 2 (14.5 oz) cans of diced tomatoes

   Rinse your 2 cans of sauce with about half a can's worth of water (you can splash back and forth to rinse) then add this sauce water to the pot.

   Add the whole peeled carrot(s), Parm rind, and bay leaves if using.

   Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low.

   **Let it simmer**

   Simmer partially covered, stirring occasionally. While it simmers, make the meatballs (step 2). The sauce wants at least 30 minutes total, longer is better. 60 to 90 minutes is excellent.

2. **Make the meatballs (while the sauce simmers)**

   **Make the panade**
  
   Pre-heat oven to 425°F (218°C).

   Combine bread and milk and let sit 5 minutes. Mash into a thick paste. If it's soupy, squeeze gently. If it's dry, add a splash more milk.

   If using the bread plus panko option, stir panko in after the bread becomes a paste.

   **Mix the flavor base**

   In a large bowl, mix thoroughly:
   - panade
   - eggs
   - Parm
   - freeze-dried parsley
   - garlic powder
   - onion powder
   - black pepper
   - fennel seed (if using)
   - nutmeg (if using)
   - 1½ Tsp kosher salt

   **Add meat and mix**

   Add the beef and pork (or veal). Mix until combined. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.

   **Test patty**

   Cook a small patty and taste. Adjust salt, pepper, and other seasoning to your taste.

   **Shape**

   Roll into 2-inch meatballs. Lightly packed, not compressed.

3. **Par-bake on a rack (your grease-control step)**

   Line sheet pans with foil. Place wire racks on top. Lightly oil the racks.

   Arrange meatballs with a little space between.

   Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until they are set and lightly browned but not fully cooked through. Optional nerd target: 120 to 130°F (49 to 54°C) internal.

   You will see a lot of fat on the pan. That's correct.

4. **Check the sauce and adjust volume if needed**

   **Sauce texture choice:**

   If you want it smoother, use an immersion blender in quick pulses. Stop before you get to a full puree.

   **Make sure the sauce volume matches the batch**

   This is where we keep it sane.

   Before adding meatballs, look at your pot and ask:

   "If I add all my meatballs, will they be mostly submerged without stacking too tightly?"
   - If yes: proceed.
   - If it looks tight: open one additional 28 oz can (sauce or whole) and simmer 10 minutes.
   - If it looks crowded or stacked: open two additional 28 oz cans, one at a time, simmering briefly between.

   Also: if your pot can't comfortably hold everything, split sauce into two pots now. (And put a bigger pot on your shopping list for next time.)

5. **Finish meatballs in the simmering sauce**

   Bring sauce back to a gentle simmer.

   Add meatballs in batches if needed so you don't break them.

   Simmer gently 25 to 40 minutes, partially covered, stirring from the bottom occasionally. Avoid boiling hard.

   **As they simmer:**
   - the meatballs finish cooking
   - the sauce thickens
   - some fat renders into the sauce (good flavor, controlled)

   **Optional: beef base**

   After the meatballs have simmered 15 to 20 minutes, taste the sauce.

   Only if it tastes hollow, dissolve and add:
   - ½ Tsp BTB or ½ Knorr pot, taste, then decide if it needs more

   Stop before it becomes stew-like.

   **End adjustments**

   Remove carrot(s), Parm rind, bay leaves.

   Taste and add, if needed:
   - salt
   - a small pinch of sugar (½ Tsp at a time)
   - if it tastes heavy, add 1 Tsp red wine vinegar or lemon juice

6. **Cook spaghetti and combine intelligently**

   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

   Cook spaghetti until just shy of al dente.

   Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain.

   **The best serving approach**

   In a large pan or pot, toss pasta with a few ladles of sauce and a splash of pasta water until glossy and well-coated.

   Serve meatballs on top. Spoon extra sauce over everything.

   Finish with Parm and parsley.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why this method works for 75/25 beef plus pork or veal

High-fat meat stays juicy, but can turn greasy. Par-baking on a rack renders excess fat early. Finishing in sauce prevents drying and adds cohesion.

### Variation: Using Italian sausage

If you prefer to use 1 lb Italian sausage (sweet, hot, or a mix) instead of ground pork or veal:

- Reduce salt significantly. Start with ½ to ¾ Tsp and finalize after a test patty. Sausage is already heavily seasoned and salted.
- Garlic and fennel may be reduced or omitted entirely, depending on your sausage brand and desired flavor profile.
- Seasoning becomes more brand-dependent. Taste your sausage first, then adjust the additional seasonings accordingly. Some sausages are already very garlicky, while others are milder.

### Oregano rule

A pinch only. Too much equals pizza. You're right.

### Sauce too thick?

Add hot water or pasta water a little at a time. This is tradition, not dilution.

### Sauce too thin?

Simmer uncovered longer. Tomatoes will concentrate.

### Meatballs dense?

Usually overmixing or overpacking. Fold gently, roll lightly.

### Meatballs falling apart?

Usually too-wet panade. Also, make sure they par-bake long enough to set before saucing.

### Storage and freezer plan

- Meatballs plus sauce keep 4 days refrigerated.
- Freeze meatballs in sauce or separately.
- Reheat gently by simmering, not microwaving into rubber.
