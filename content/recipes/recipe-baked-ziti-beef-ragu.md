This version intentionally mirrors the tomato structure of your Italian American Spaghetti and Meatballs. The difference is architectural, not proportional. Here the sauce is not built to submerge meatballs, but it remains generous and freezer-worthy.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** wide heavy pot or Dutch oven; wooden spoon; 2½ to 3 qt oven-safe baking dish; large pasta pot
- **Oven setting:** 375°F (190°C)
- **Stove setting:** medium-high for browning; low gentle simmer
- **Batch size:** one baked pasta plus multiple quarts leftover ragù

## Ingredients

### Beef ragù base (large batch)

- 3 lb ground beef (75/25)
- 2 large yellow onions, finely diced
- 6 to 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (6 oz) can tomato paste
- 2 (28 oz) cans tomato sauce
- 2 (28 oz) cans whole tomatoes, crushed
- 2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes
- Salt and pepper

### Pasta and layers

- 1 lb tubular pasta
- 12 to 16 oz low-moisture mozzarella
- 15 oz ricotta (optional)
- 1 egg (if using ricotta)
- 1 cup grated Parmesan

## Method

1. **Brown aggressively**

   Work in batches. Let the beef develop real color before breaking it up. This is the backbone of the sauce.

2. **Build the tomato base**

   Cook onions until soft. Add garlic briefly. Cook tomato paste until brick red. Add all tomatoes and return beef to the pot.

3. **Simmer for cohesion**

   Simmer 60 to 90 minutes until slightly thickened but still saucy. This is not tight Bolognese. It should ladle easily but not look watery.

4. **Undercook the pasta**

   Stop 2 to 3 minutes shy of al dente.

5. **Layer intentionally**

   Lightly coat pasta first. Spread a thin base of sauce in the dish. Add pasta, more ragù, ricotta mixture if using, mozzarella, and repeat. Finish with sauce and cheese. Fill no higher than ¾ in below the rim.

6. **Bake and rest**

   Cover and bake 25 to 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 to 25 minutes more until bubbling and lightly browned. Rest 15 to 20 minutes before cutting.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why this tomato volume works

This mirrors the spaghetti-and-meatballs sauce backbone. You are making a generous pot intentionally. Some goes into the bake. The rest goes to the freezer.

### Fat management

With 75/25 beef, drain rendered fat after browning. If fat pools after simmering, skim lightly before layering.

### Sauce texture test

Spoon onto a plate. If liquid spreads outward quickly, simmer longer before assembling.

### Dish size flexibility

Works in:

- 9×13 (shallower, 2 layers)
- 9×9 deep (3 layers)
- Any 2½ to 3 qt dish

Fill no closer than ¾ in to the rim.

### Mozzarella format

- Shredded melts faster.
- Sliced creates creamier pockets. Cut slices into smaller pieces and space evenly.

### Freezer plan

Cool extra ragù completely. Portion and freeze. Label it. Future you will not remember.

- Do not overcook the pasta.
- Do not flood the layers with sauce.
- Do not cut before resting.

## Credit where it's due

This recipe builds directly from the Italian American Spaghetti and Meatballs on this site, adapting the same layered tomato base into a baked pasta format with generous yield.
