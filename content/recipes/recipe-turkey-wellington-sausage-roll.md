  - "1 large egg"
  - "2–3 tbsp milk/cream or turkey/chicken stock"
  - "1½–2 tsp kosher salt (start on the low end if your salt is fine-grained)"
  - "1½ tsp dried sage"
  - "1 tsp dried thyme"
  - "½ tsp dried rosemary, crushed between your fingers"
  - "½ tsp black pepper"
  - "A small pinch of ground nutmeg (⅛–¼ tsp)"
  - "2 cloves garlic, very finely minced or grated"

  - "1–2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional)"
  - "Optional: pinch more sage/thyme"
  - "2 standard sheets all-butter puff pastry (≈10x10 in / 25x25 cm each)"
  - "1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water or milk (for egg wash)"
  - "Optional: flaky salt, black pepper, or sesame/poppy seeds for topping"
  - "Turkey gravy, piping hot, for serving"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Make the turkey sausage: Combine the ground turkey with all sausage ingredients (breadcrumbs, egg, milk/stock, salt, herbs, garlic, and extra fat). Mix gently until cohesive and a bit sticky, but not pasty. Cook a tiny patty to taste for salt and seasoning—this \"test patty\" trick helps you adjust before committing. Chill the bowl of sausage while you deal with the stuffing."
  - "Make and prep the stuffing: Cook the Stove Top with reduced liquid (use about 75–80% of what the box calls for to keep it moldable instead of squishy). Before adding the mix, sauté the onion and celery in butter until soft and fragrant, then add your water/stock and bring to a boil. Stir in stuffing mix and cook as directed. Cool a bit, then measure out 3 packed cups into a mixing bowl. Stir in 1 beaten egg and any extra herbs. Spread this stuffing on a plate or tray and refrigerate until cool and slightly firm."
  - "Form sausage \"cores\" and wrap in stuffing: Divide the sausage into 4 equal portions. On a piece of plastic wrap, roll each portion into a log about 10–11\" long and roughly ¾–1\" thick. On a new piece of plastic wrap, press some stuffing into a thin rectangle slightly longer than the sausage log and wide enough to wrap around it at about ¼\" thickness. Lay a sausage log on the stuffing rectangle. Use the plastic wrap to lift and roll the stuffing around the sausage, like sushi, so the sausage is in the center and the stuffing is an even coat around it. Twist the plastic wrap ends to firm it up into a neat cylinder. Repeat for all sausage portions. Chill these stuffing-wrapped logs in the fridge at least 30 minutes, or give them 10–15 minutes in the freezer to really firm up."
  - "Wrap in puff pastry: Heat oven to 400°F / 200°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Roll each puff pastry sheet to about 10x12\" and cut it lengthwise into two long strips (≈5x12\" each). You now have 4 strips. Unwrap a chilled stuffing-wrapped log and lay it down the center of a pastry strip, leaving ½–¾\" bare pastry at each short end. Brush one long edge of the pastry lightly with egg wash. Fold the other long edge up and over the filling, then bring the egg-washed edge up to meet it, overlapping slightly. Press to seal. Roll the log so the seam faces down. Trim the ends if the pastry wildly overhangs, but leave the ends open so you see stuffing/sausage, like a classic sausage roll. Repeat with all logs."
  - "Portion, vent, and bake: Move the 4 long rolls to your lined sheet, seam-side down. Cut each long roll into 2 pieces for big mains (8 total) or 3 for slightly smaller portions. Using a sharp knife, cut small diagonal slits in the tops for steam vents, cutting through the pastry but not all the way through the filling. Brush the tops and sides with egg wash. Optional: sprinkle with flaky salt, black pepper, or sesame/poppy seeds. Bake at 400°F / 200°C for about 25–35 minutes. Rotate the tray halfway through. Start checking the internal temperature in the center of a roll at 25 minutes. You want at least 165°F (74°C) in the sausage layer for poultry safety. If the pastry is getting deeply golden but the center is only, say, 150–155°F, tent loosely with foil and keep baking until it hits temp. Let rest 5–10 minutes so the juices settle, then serve with piping hot turkey gravy for dipping."

I'm starting to prep for Thanksgiving 2025, but I literally cannot be convinced to roast a turkey this year. So instead I'm doing a mashed up hybrid of classic British sausage rolls, holiday turkey flavors, and the architecture of a Wellington that can be dunked into a vat of gravy. Because of course.

Alongside the turkey Wellington Franken-rolls, I'm also making:
* Turkey gravy
* [Sweet potato casserole](/recipes/2025-11-14/recipe-sweet-potato-casserole/)
* [Duck fat roasted potatoes](https://www.poppycooks.com/recipes/goose-fat-roasties/)
* Roasted Brussels sprouts
* [Classic cranberry sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-thanksgiving-special-the-worlds-easiest-cranberry-sauce)

So, let's get started!

## Method

1. **Make the turkey sausage.**

   Combine the ground turkey with all sausage ingredients (breadcrumbs, egg, milk/stock, salt, herbs, garlic, and extra fat). Mix gently until cohesive and a bit sticky, but not pasty. Cook a tiny patty to taste for salt and seasoning—this "test patty" trick helps you adjust before committing. Chill the bowl of sausage while you deal with the stuffing.

2. **Make and prep the stuffing.**

   Cook the Stove Top with reduced liquid (use about 75–80% of what the box calls for to keep it moldable instead of squishy). Before adding the mix, sauté the onion and celery in butter until soft and fragrant, then add your water/stock and bring to a boil. Stir in stuffing mix and cook as directed.

   Cool a bit, then measure out 3 packed cups into a mixing bowl. Stir in 1 beaten egg and any extra herbs. Spread this stuffing on a plate or tray and refrigerate until cool and slightly firm.

3. **Form sausage "cores" and wrap in stuffing.**

   Divide the sausage into 4 equal portions. On a piece of plastic wrap, roll each portion into a log about 10–11" long and roughly ¾–1" thick. (We're aiming for a total filling diameter, after stuffing, of no more than about 1½" / 4 cm.)

   On a new piece of plastic wrap, press some stuffing into a thin rectangle slightly longer than the sausage log and wide enough to wrap around it at about ¼" thickness. Lay a sausage log on the stuffing rectangle. Use the plastic wrap to lift and roll the stuffing around the sausage, like sushi, so the sausage is in the center and the stuffing is an even coat around it. Twist the plastic wrap ends to firm it up into a neat cylinder.

   Repeat for all sausage portions. Chill these stuffing-wrapped logs in the fridge at least 30 minutes, or give them 10–15 minutes in the freezer to really firm up.

4. **Wrap in puff pastry.**

   Heat oven to 400°F / 200°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

   Roll each puff pastry sheet to about 10x12" and cut it lengthwise into two long strips (≈5x12" each). You now have 4 strips.

   Unwrap a chilled stuffing-wrapped log and lay it down the center of a pastry strip, leaving ½–¾" bare pastry at each short end. Brush one long edge of the pastry lightly with egg wash. Fold the other long edge up and over the filling, then bring the egg-washed edge up to meet it, overlapping slightly. Press to seal. Roll the log so the seam faces down. Trim the ends if the pastry wildly overhangs, but leave the ends open so you see stuffing/sausage, like a classic sausage roll.

   Repeat with all logs. You now have 4 long rolls.

5. **Portion, vent, and bake.**

   Move the 4 long rolls to your lined sheet, seam-side down. Cut each long roll into 2 pieces for big mains (8 total) or 3 for slightly smaller portions.

   Using a sharp knife, cut small diagonal slits in the tops for steam vents, cutting through the pastry but not all the way through the filling. Brush the tops and sides with egg wash. Optional: sprinkle with flaky salt, black pepper, or sesame/poppy seeds.

   Bake at 400°F / 200°C for about 25–35 minutes. Rotate the tray halfway through. Start checking the internal temperature in the center of a roll at 25 minutes. You want at least 165°F (74°C) in the sausage layer for poultry safety. If the pastry is getting deeply golden but the center is only, say, 150–155°F, tent loosely with foil and keep baking until it hits temp.

   Let rest 5–10 minutes so the juices settle, then serve with piping hot turkey gravy for dipping.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why the panade?
Breadcrumbs + egg + a little liquid = a panade (moist bread paste) that keeps lean turkey from being dry or rubbery. This is exactly how a lot of turkey sausage roll recipes get a juicy texture.

### Keeping layers thin
The key constraint: when you wrap it around the sausage, try to keep the stuffing layer to about ¼ inch thick. More than ~⅜ inch and you start needing longer cook times and risking soggy pastry.

### Making everything extra-savory (optional upgrades)
Once the base works, you can stack flavor:
- **Bacon + mushrooms in the filling:** Fry bacon, onion, mushrooms, and garlic together, then mix this into the turkey and/or stuffing; it adds fat and that "roasty pan drippings" vibe.
- **Cheese boost:** A handful of finely grated Parmesan or Gruyère folded into the stuffing portion you're using for the rolls will turn up savoriness without screaming "cheese."
- **Herb butter glaze:** Melt butter with chopped sage/thyme and a tiny bit of garlic; brush over the rolls in the last 5 minutes of baking.
- **Supercharged gravy:** Whisk a spoonful of soy sauce or Worcestershire into your turkey gravy for extra depth, or simmer it briefly with a few dried mushrooms, then strain.

### Make-ahead notes
Sausage rolls in general freeze incredibly well—many recipes assemble, then freeze the unbaked rolls and bake straight from frozen or after a brief thaw.

For this version:
- You can fully assemble up through wrapping in pastry and cutting, then freeze on a tray until solid and transfer to a bag.
- Bake from chilled (not rock hard) so the center cooks through before the pastry burns; add extra time and rely on the thermometer.

### All-butter pastry
Use all-butter puff pastry if you can find it; it makes a big flavor difference in all the sausage roll recipes. The texture and taste are noticeably better than standard puff pastry.
