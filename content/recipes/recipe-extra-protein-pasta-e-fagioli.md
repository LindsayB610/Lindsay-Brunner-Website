For as long as I can remember, pasta e fagioli has been my mom's favorite soup. When I was little it grossed me out, but as an adult it's one of my faves too. This version ups the protein with added Italian sausage, because I, like everyone, am chasing that daily protein intake. The recipe is built from my pantry staples to feel like a meal, but still comes together simply. It's savory without being spicy, rich without being heavy, and it gets even better as leftovers.

- 1 leek, thinly sliced and washed
- 5 to 6 cloves garlic, minced

### Spices and tomato base

- 1 Tsp dried rosemary
- 1 Tsp paprika (unless it's already represented in your Italian seasoning)

- 1 Knorr Rich Beef Stock Pot*
- 1 Tsp Better Than Bouillon chicken*
- ½ Tsp Better Than Bouillon vegetable*
- 2 (15 oz) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- Parm rind (optional)
*Use what you have, don't fret about having the exact same mix. This is a forgiving soup.

### Pasta and greens

- 1 cup dry ditalini pasta
- 1 cup spinach or kale (fresh or frozen)

### Finishing

- ¾ cup finely grated Parmesan, divided
- Lemon juice, to taste (optional)

## Method

1. **Brown the sausage**

   Warm a large heavy pot over medium heat with a small drizzle of olive oil. Add the sausage, break it up, and let it brown thoroughly. Transfer the browned sausage to a bowl with a slotted spoon.

2. **Cook the aromatics**

   Add the onion and leek to the pot and cook until softened, stirring and scraping up browned bits. Add garlic and cook just until fragrant.

3. **Build the base**

   Stir in the Italian seasoning blend, rosemary, paprika (if using), and black pepper. Add tomato paste and cook until it deepens to brick red.

4. **Simmer the soup**

   Return the sausage to the pot. Add tomatoes, beans, and 6 cups water. Stir in the stock pot and both bouillon pastes. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook 10 to 15 minutes. (If you're boiling your pasta separately, add the pasta cooking time to this simmer step, something like an additional 10 minutes.)

   If you're using a Parm rind, throw it in here.

5. **Cook the pasta**

   Add the ditalini and simmer until tender, stirring occasionally so it does not stick. (Or boil separately, see Notes section.)

6. **Finish**

   Stir in the greens until wilted. Fish out the Parm rind, if you added one. Turn off the heat and stir in about ¼ to ⅓ cup Parmesan until melted. Taste and adjust with lemon juice if needed. Serve with the remaining Parmesan.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Broth base choices

Blending concentrated stocks from what you have on hand keeps this pantry-forward. The Knorr Rich Beef Stock Pot brings savory depth that pairs beautifully with sausage. Better Than Bouillon chicken adds roundness, and a little vegetable boosts the aromatics without heaviness.

### Pasta and thickness

The soup will thicken as it sits because the pasta continues to absorb liquid. When reheating, add a splash of water or broth and stir until you reach your preferred consistency.

You can also boil the pasta separately, drain it, and add it to the bottom of each bowl at serving time. This keeps the pasta from getting mushy if you have leftovers, and gives you more control over the soup-to-pasta ratio.

### Cheese and texture

Add Parmesan off the heat so it melts smoothly into the soup. If you add it while the soup is boiling, the texture can turn grainy.

### Heat level

Half hot sausage in this amount of broth reads as warm, not spicy. If you are sensitive to heat, use more sweet sausage and less hot.

### Greens flexibility

Spinach wilts very quickly and adds color and freshness. If you prefer kale, toss it in a few minutes earlier so it softens.

I've also used this soup as a change to use up leftover veg, I've thrown in a cup or two of sauteed peas and sugar snaps, or the same amount of sauteed zucchini.
