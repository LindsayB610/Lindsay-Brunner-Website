## Method

1. **Brown the sausage**

   Warm a large heavy pot over medium heat with a small drizzle of olive oil. Add the sausage, break it up, and let it brown thoroughly. Transfer the browned sausage to a bowl with a slotted spoon.

2. **Cook the aromatics**

   Add the onion and leek to the pot and cook until softened, stirring and scraping up browned bits. Add garlic and cook just until fragrant.

3. **Build the base**

   Stir in the basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, paprika, and black pepper. Add tomato paste and cook until it deepens to brick red.

4. **Simmer the soup**

   Return the sausage to the pot. Add tomatoes, beans, and 6 cups water. Stir in the stock pot and both bouillon pastes. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook 10 to 15 minutes.

5. **Cook the pasta**

   Add the ditalini and simmer until tender, stirring occasionally so it does not stick. (Or boil separately, see Notes section.)

6. **Finish**

   Stir in the greens until wilted. Turn off the heat and stir in about ¼ to ⅓ cup Parmesan until melted. Taste and adjust with lemon juice if needed. Serve with the remaining Parmesan.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Broth base choices

Blending concentrated stocks from what you have on hand keeps this pantry-forward. The Knorr Rich Beef Stock Pot brings savory depth that pairs beautifully with sausage. Better Than Bouillon chicken adds roundness, and a little vegetable boosts the aromatics without heaviness.

### Pasta and thickness

The soup will thicken as it sits because the pasta continues to absorb liquid. When reheating, add a splash of water or broth and stir until you reach your preferred consistency.

You can also boil the pasta separately, drain it, and add it to the bottom of each bowl at serving time. This keeps the pasta from getting mushy if you have leftovers, and gives you more control over the soup-to-pasta ratio.

### Cheese and texture

Add Parmesan off the heat so it melts smoothly into the soup. If you add it while the soup is boiling, the texture can turn grainy.

### Heat level

Half hot sausage in this amount of broth reads as warm, not spicy. If you are sensitive to heat, use more sweet sausage and less hot.

### Greens flexibility

Spinach wilts very quickly and adds color and freshness. If you prefer kale, toss it in a few minutes earlier so it softens.
