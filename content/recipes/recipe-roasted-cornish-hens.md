Lucas calls Cornish hens "tiny chickens," which is objectively better branding and the main reason they stay in rotation around here. There is something about putting a whole half-bird on a plate that feels festive, even if it's just a Thursday and everyone is slightly feral. The reality is far less dramatic. You split them, pat them dry like you mean it, rub them with olive oil, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and enough salt to matter, and roast them cut side down until the skin turns properly golden. They cook evenly, they crisp reliably, and they feel far more impressive than the actual effort involved. If you dry the birds well and salt confidently, the oven does the rest and you get a lean, satisfying dinner that reads like you tried much harder than you did.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** rimmed baking sheet; paper towels; instant-read thermometer
- **Oven setting:** 375°F (190°C)
- **Batch size:** 4 servings (½ hen per person)

## Ingredients

- 2 Cornish hens, thawed and split in half
- 1 to 2 Tbsp olive oil (or melted chicken schmaltz)
- 1½ Tsp kosher salt (or to taste)
- 1 Tsp garlic powder
- 1 Tsp dried Italian seasoning
- ½ Tsp freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. **Preheat and dry**

   Heat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Pat the hens completely dry with paper towels. Dry skin is the difference between pale and crisp.

2. **Season simply**

   Rub the hens lightly with your fat of choice on all sides. Season evenly with kosher salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and black pepper.

3. **Arrange cut side down**

   Place the hens cut side down on a rimmed baking sheet. This protects the breast meat and promotes even cooking.

4. **Roast**

   Roast for 50 to 60 minutes, checking for doneness at the 50-minute mark. The thickest part of the thigh should read 165°F (74°C), and the skin should be golden.

5. **Optional crisp finish**

   If the skin needs more color you can broil for 2 to 3 minutes. Watch closely.

6. **Rest and serve**

   Rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving to allow juices to settle.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Split vs whole

Splitting the hens helps them cook more evenly and gives you better surface area for crisping. If roasting whole, expect closer to 60 to 70 minutes total cook time.

### Seasoning adjustments

This recipe is intentionally simple. You can add lemon zest, fresh herbs, or smoked paprika without changing the structure.

- Do not skip drying the birds.
- Do not under-salt.
- Do not pull before 165°F (74°C) in the thigh.
