recipeIngredient:
  - "1 stick (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened"
  - "1 cup granulated sugar"
  - "2 large eggs"
  - "2 cups all-purpose flour"
  - "2 teaspoons baking powder"
  - "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
  - "⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
  - "½ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
  - "¼ cup heavy cream"
  - "¼ cup water"
  - "2 tablespoons full-fat Greek yogurt"
  - "2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
  - "⅛ teaspoon almond extract"
  - "1½ cups chopped pecans, lightly toasted"
  - "1 cup packed light brown sugar"
  - "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened"
  - "4–5 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
  - "Pinch Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Preheat and prep the pan: Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5 loaf pan and line it with parchment so it overhangs the long sides for easy lifting later."
  - "Make the pecan crumb topping: Toast the pecans in a 350°F oven for 6–8 minutes until fragrant, then cool completely. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, 4 tablespoons flour, pecans, and a pinch of salt. Add the softened butter and mix until clumpy. If the mixture looks loose or greasy, stir in the remaining flour 1 tablespoon at a time. Chill the topping while you make the batter."
  - "Mix the cake batter: In a medium bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 2–3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition."
  - "Combine the dry and wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a measuring cup, stir together the heavy cream, water, and Greek yogurt until smooth."
  - "Finish the batter: Add about half of the dry ingredients to the butter–sugar–egg mixture and mix just until combined. Add the cream mixture and mix briefly. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix just until no dry spots remain. Stir in the vanilla and almond extract by hand, scraping the bowl well. The batter will be thick and scoopable."
  - "Assemble the loaf: Spread about 55–60 percent of the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Sprinkle roughly one third of the chilled crumb topping over the batter in a thin, even layer. Spoon the remaining batter over the topping in small dollops and gently spread it into an even layer without dragging the streusel. Scatter the remaining crumb topping evenly over the surface and press very lightly so it adheres."
  - "Bake: Bake at 350°F for 50–60 minutes, checking around 45 minutes. A tester inserted slightly off center should come out with moist crumbs but no wet batter. If the topping browns before the center is done, tent the loaf loosely with foil and continue baking."
  - "Cool and slice: Let the loaf cool in the pan for about 15 minutes so the crumb can set. Lift out using the parchment and cool on a rack until just warm or fully cooled before slicing."

So, I was testing a new recipe last weekend for [Fluffy BBQ-Style Sweet Potato Casserole](/recipes/2025-11-14/recipe-sweet-potato-casserole/), and it turns out I planned for way more pecan topping than I needed. Like, double what I needed. This is what happens when Midwestern mom energy and maximalism combine. Or maybe those were already synonyms.

Once I had a bowl of leftover pecan topping staring me down, the answer was obvious: coffee cake. This version borrows from a classic cinnamon crumb loaf and pushes it just far enough to feel intentional. The crumb is soft and plush thanks to heavy cream and Greek yogurt, the cinnamon stays front and center, and the pecan topping shows up twice because moderation is overrated.

This lands squarely in "breakfast cake, not cake for breakfast" territory.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** medium mixing bowl; small bowl; hand mixer or sturdy whisk; rubber spatula; 9×5 loaf pan; parchment
- **Oven setting:** 350°F (175°C) for 50–60 minutes
- **Batch size:** one 9×5 loaf (about 8–10 slices)

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Streusel yield and layering

This recipe makes about **3 cups total streusel**. Use roughly **1 cup for the middle ripple** and **2 cups on top**. Keep the middle layer thin and even. You want a ripple, not a slab.

### Greek yogurt

The 2 tablespoons of Greek yogurt add moisture without thinning the batter. Increasing it will soften the crumb further and may require a longer bake.

### Topping texture

Cold, clumpy streusel is essential. Warm topping melts and sinks. Chill it while the batter is mixed.

### Toaster oven baking

If baking in a toaster oven, use the lowest rack position and expect to tent earlier, often around 30–35 minutes. Watch topping color more than the clock.

### Storage

Best the day it's baked. Keeps wrapped at room temperature for 1–2 days. Slices freeze well and can be refreshed in a low oven to re-crisp the topping.
