recipeIngredient:
  - "1 stick (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened"
  - "1 Cup granulated sugar"
  - "2 large eggs"
  - "2 Cups all‑purpose flour"
  - "2 teaspoons baking powder"
  - "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
  - "⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
  - "½ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
  - "¼ Cup heavy cream"
  - "¼ Cup Greek yogurt"
  - "2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
  - "⅛ teaspoon almond extract"
  - "¾ Cup chopped pecans, lightly roasted"
  - "½ Cup packed light brown sugar"
  - "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened"
  - "2–3 tablespoons all‑purpose flour (2 Tbsp = more nut‑forward, 3 Tbsp = more streusel‑y)"
  - "Pinch Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Preheat and prep the pan: Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5 loaf pan and line it with a strip of parchment so it overhangs the long sides for easy lifting later."
  - "Make the pecan crumb topping: If you haven't already, lightly roast the chopped pecans until fragrant and let them cool. Stir together the brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, pecans, and a pinch of salt. Add the softened butter and mix until the topping forms clumps when squeezed. If it looks a bit too loose, stir in the extra tablespoon of flour. Pop the bowl in the fridge while you make the batter so the topping firms up and doesn't sink into the cake."
  - "Mix the cake batter: In a medium mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together with a hand mixer (or vigorous whisk) until light and fluffy, 2–3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing until smooth after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a measuring cup, combine the heavy cream and Greek yogurt. Add about half of the dry mixture to the butter–sugar–egg mixture and mix on low just until the flour disappears. Pour in the cream‑and‑yogurt mixture and mix again briefly. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Stir in the vanilla and almond extract by hand with a spatula, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl."
  - "Assemble the loaf: Spread half of the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth it gently. Break up half of the chilled pecan crumb topping and scatter it evenly over the batter. Spread the remaining batter over the topping layer, then scatter the remaining topping over the top in a thick, bumpy layer. Press very lightly so it adheres without compacting or sinking."
  - "Bake: Bake at 350°F for 45–55 minutes. Start checking around 40–45 minutes: a tester inserted in the center should come out with a few moist crumbs but no wet batter. If the topping is browning faster than the middle is baking, tent the loaf loosely with foil for the last 10–15 minutes."
  - "Cool and slice: Let the loaf cool in the pan for about 15 minutes so the crumb can set. Use the parchment to lift it out to a rack and let it cool until just warm or room temperature. Slice into thick pieces and serve as breakfast, snack, or coffee companion."

So, I was testing a new recipe last weekend, for [Fluffy BBQ‑Style Sweet Potato Casserole](/recipes/2025-11-14/recipe-sweet-potato-casserole/), and turns out I planned for WAY more pecan topping than I needed. Like, double what I needed. This is what happens when midwestern mom and maximalist combine. Or, maybe those were already synonyms?

Anyway.

Now I had the problem of what to do with all this extra pecan topping, and of course the obvious choice was to bake a coffee cake. And why use just one recipe as a base when I could hack together several and then rewrite parts of each to be exactly the coffee cake I want to eat.

This version is super tender, cinnamon-forward, and exactly walks the line of "breakfast cake, not cake for breakfast."

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** medium mixing bowl; small bowl; hand mixer (or sturdy whisk); rubber spatula; 9×5 loaf pan; parchment
- **Oven setting:** 350°F (175°C) for 45–55 minutes
- **Batch size:** one 9×5 loaf (about 8–10 slices)

## Ingredients

### Cake

- 1 stick (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 Cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 Cups all‑purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- ¼ Cup heavy cream
- ¼ Cup Greek yogurt
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon almond extract

### Pecan crumb topping

(You'll need enough for two layers: one in the middle of the cake and one on top. If you ever have leftover topping from the [Sweet Potato Casserole](/recipes/2025-11-14/recipe-sweet-potato-casserole/), you can use about 1½ cups of that here. Otherwise, make this fresh.)

- ¾ Cup chopped pecans, lightly toasted
- ½ Cup packed light brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2–3 tablespoons all‑purpose flour (2 Tbsp = more nut‑forward, 3 Tbsp = more streusel‑y)
- Pinch Diamond Crystal kosher salt

Lightly roast the pecans in a dry skillet or a 350°F oven until fragrant, then let them cool. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, pecans, and a pinch of salt. Stir in the softened butter until everything is evenly moistened and clumpy. If you want a thicker, more crumbly blanket, stir in the third tablespoon of flour.

## Method

1. **Preheat and prep the pan.**

   Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5 loaf pan and line it with a strip of parchment so it overhangs the long sides for easy lifting later.

2. **Make the pecan crumb topping.**

   Toast the pecans: Heat oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread chopped pecans on a sheet pan and toast 6–8 minutes until just fragrant and a shade deeper. Cool completely (warm nuts will melt the streusel butter).

   Stir together the brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cooled toasted pecans, and a pinch of salt. Add the softened butter and mix until the topping forms clumps when squeezed. If it looks a bit too loose, stir in the extra tablespoon of flour. Pop the bowl in the fridge while you make the batter so the topping firms up and doesn't sink into the cake.

3. **Mix the cake batter.**

   In a medium mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together with a hand mixer (or vigorous whisk) until light and fluffy, 2–3 minutes.

   Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing until smooth after each addition.

   In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a measuring cup, combine the heavy cream and Greek yogurt.

   Add about half of the dry mixture to the butter–sugar–egg mixture and mix on low just until the flour disappears. Pour in the cream‑and‑yogurt mixture and mix again briefly. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Stir in the vanilla and almond extract by hand with a spatula, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl.

4. **Assemble the loaf.**

   Spread half of the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth it gently. Break up half of the chilled pecan crumb topping and scatter it evenly over the batter. Spread the remaining batter over the topping layer, then scatter the remaining topping over the top in a thick, bumpy layer. Press very lightly so it adheres without compacting or sinking.

5. **Bake.**

   Bake at 350°F for 45–55 minutes. Start checking around 40–45 minutes: a tester inserted in the center should come out with a few moist crumbs but no wet batter.

   If the topping is browning faster than the middle is baking, tent the loaf loosely with foil for the last 10–15 minutes.

6. **Cool and slice.**

   Let the loaf cool in the pan for about 15 minutes so the crumb can set. Use the parchment to lift it out to a rack and let it cool until just warm or room temperature. Slice into thick pieces and serve as breakfast, snack, or coffee companion.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Heavy cream and Greek yogurt

The combination of heavy cream and Greek yogurt gives this loaf a tender, moist crumb with a subtle tang. The yogurt adds structure and helps keep the cake from being too rich, while the cream provides the necessary fat for a tender texture.

- The ¼ cup cream + ¼ cup Greek yogurt balance keeps the loaf tender without being too heavy.
- If you want a slightly richer version, you can use ⅓ cup cream + 3 Tbsp Greek yogurt, but going much heavier risks a gummy center.

### Pecan choices and roasting

- Roasting the pecans before they go into the topping brings out a toasty, buttery flavor that stands up well to the cinnamon and brown sugar.
- You can swap in walnuts 1:1 if that's what you have; the topping will lean a little earthier but still works beautifully.
- Keep the nut pieces on the chunky side so the topping has texture instead of turning sandy.

### Built‑in flavor upgrades

The base recipe already uses cinnamon, fresh nutmeg, and a tiny bit of almond extract for quiet complexity. If you want to nudge it further without overwhelming the loaf:

- **Brown butter move:** Brown half of the butter for the cake batter, let it cool, then cream it with the remaining softened butter. This adds a subtle toffee note that loves pecans and brown sugar.
- **Extra tang:** The recipe already includes Greek yogurt for tenderness and a subtle tang. If you want more tang, you can swap 1–2 tablespoons of the heavy cream for additional Greek yogurt.
- **Brown sugar swap in the batter:** Trade 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar for dark brown sugar to deepen the caramel flavor.
- **Cardamom pinch:** Add a tiny pinch (less than 1⁄16 teaspoon) of ground cardamom to the dry ingredients if you want a slightly café‑ish, spiced‑latte vibe.

Pick one, maybe two of these at a time; stacking all of them pushes the cake toward "spice project" instead of "everyday coffee cake."

### Make‑ahead and storage

- The loaf is at its best the day it's baked, once cooled to just warm.
- Cooled leftovers keep well, wrapped, at room temperature for 1–2 days. The crumb will firm up slightly; a quick rewarm in a low oven makes the topping crisp again.
- You can also freeze slices tightly wrapped; thaw at room temperature and refresh in the oven if you want the streusel to re‑crisp.
