recipeIngredient:
  - "1 stick (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened"
  - "1 cup granulated sugar"
  - "2 large eggs"
  - "2 cups all-purpose flour"
  - "2 Tsp baking powder"
  - "1 Tsp ground cinnamon"
  - "⅛ Tsp freshly grated nutmeg"
  - "½ Tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
  - "¼ cup heavy cream"
  - "¼ cup water"
  - "2 Tbsp full-fat Greek yogurt"
  - "2 Tsp vanilla extract"
  - "⅛ Tsp almond extract"
  - "1½ cups chopped pecans, lightly toasted"
  - "1 cup packed light brown sugar"
  - "6 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened"
  - "4–5 Tbsp all-purpose flour"
  - "Pinch Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Preheat and prep the pan. Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5 loaf pan and line it with parchment so it overhangs the long sides for easy lifting later."
  - "Make the pecan crumb topping. Toast the pecans at 350°F (175°C) for 6–8 minutes until fragrant, then cool completely. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, 4 Tbsp flour, pecans, and a pinch of salt. Add the softened butter and mix until clumpy. If the mixture looks loose or greasy, stir in the remaining flour 1 Tbsp at a time. Chill the topping while you make the batter."
  - "Mix the cake batter. Cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 2–3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition."
  - "Combine the dry and wet ingredients. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Stir together the heavy cream, water, and Greek yogurt until smooth."
  - "Finish the batter. Add about half of the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar-egg mixture and mix just until combined. Add the cream mixture and mix briefly. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix just until no dry spots remain. Stir in the vanilla and almond extract by hand, scraping the bowl well. The batter will be thick and scoopable."
  - "Assemble the loaf. Spread about 55–60% of the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Sprinkle about one third of the chilled crumb topping over the batter in a thin, even layer. Spoon the remaining batter over the topping in small dollops and gently spread it into an even layer without dragging the streusel. Scatter the remaining crumb topping evenly over the surface and press very lightly so it adheres."
  - "Bake. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 50–60 minutes, checking around 45 minutes. A tester inserted slightly off center should come out with moist crumbs but no wet batter. If the topping browns before the center is done, tent the loaf loosely with foil and continue baking."
  - "Cool and slice. Let the loaf cool in the pan for about 15 minutes so the crumb can set. Lift out using the parchment and cool on a rack until just warm or fully cooled before slicing."

I was testing a new recipe last weekend for [Fluffy BBQ-Style Sweet Potato Casserole](/recipes/2025-11-14/recipe-sweet-potato-casserole/), and it turns out I planned for way more pecan topping than I needed. Like, double what I needed. This is what happens when Midwestern mom energy and maximalism combine. Or maybe those were already synonyms?

Once I had a bowl of extra pecan topping staring me down, the answer was obvious: coffee cake. This version borrows from a classic cinnamon crumb loaf, then pushes it one notch further. The crumb is soft and plush thanks to heavy cream and Greek yogurt, the cinnamon stays front and center, and the pecan topping shows up twice because moderation is overrated.

This lands squarely in "breakfast cake, not cake for breakfast" territory.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** medium mixing bowl; small bowl; hand mixer or sturdy whisk; rubber spatula; 9×5 loaf pan; parchment
- **Oven setting:** 350°F (175°C) for 50–60 minutes
- **Batch size:** one 9×5 loaf (about 8–10 slices)

## Ingredients

### Cake

- 1 stick (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 Tsp baking powder
- 1 Tsp ground cinnamon
- ⅛ Tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- ½ Tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- ¼ cup water
- 2 Tbsp full-fat Greek yogurt
- 2 Tsp vanilla extract
- ⅛ Tsp almond extract

### Pecan crumb topping

This makes about 3 cups total streusel, enough for a middle ripple and a thick top layer.

- 1½ cups chopped pecans, lightly toasted
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
- 4–5 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- Pinch Diamond Crystal kosher salt

## Method

1. **Preheat and prep the pan**

   Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5 loaf pan and line it with parchment so it overhangs the long sides.

2. **Toast the pecans**

   Spread chopped pecans on a sheet pan and toast at 350°F (175°C) for 6–8 minutes, until just fragrant and a shade deeper. Cool completely. Warm nuts will melt the streusel butter.

3. **Make the crumb topping**

   In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, 4 Tbsp flour, cooled toasted pecans, and a pinch of salt. Add the softened butter and mix until clumpy. If it looks loose or greasy, add more flour 1 Tbsp at a time until it holds in soft clumps when squeezed. Chill while you make the batter.

4. **Mix the cake batter**

   Cream the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2–3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

5. **Combine the dry and wet ingredients**

   Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Stir together the heavy cream, water, and Greek yogurt until smooth.

6. **Finish the batter**

   Add about half of the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar-egg mixture and mix just until combined. Add the cream mixture and mix briefly. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix just until no dry spots remain. Stir in the vanilla and almond extract by hand, scraping the bowl well.

   The batter will be thick and scoopable. This is correct.

7. **Assemble with a streusel ripple**

   Spread about 55–60% of the batter evenly in the prepared pan.

   Sprinkle about one third of the chilled crumb topping over the batter in a thin, even layer. Do not press it down.

   Spoon the remaining batter over the topping in small dollops and gently spread it into an even layer without dragging the streusel through the batter.

   Scatter the remaining crumb topping evenly over the surface and press very lightly so it adheres.

8. **Bake**

   Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 50–60 minutes, checking around 45 minutes. A tester inserted slightly off center should come out with moist crumbs but no wet batter.

   If the topping browns before the center is done, tent the loaf loosely with foil and continue baking.

9. **Cool and slice**

   Let the loaf cool in the pan for about 15 minutes so the crumb can set. Lift out using the parchment and cool on a rack until just warm or fully cooled before slicing.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Streusel yield and layering

This recipe makes about 3 cups total streusel. Use roughly 1 cup for the middle ripple and 2 cups on top. Keep the middle layer thin and even. You want a ripple, not a slab.

### Greek yogurt

The 2 Tbsp of Greek yogurt add moisture without thinning the batter. Increasing it will soften the crumb and may require a longer bake.

### Toaster oven baking

If baking in a toaster oven, use the lowest rack position and expect to tent earlier, often around 30–35 minutes. Watch topping color more than the clock.

### Storage

Best the day it's baked. Keeps wrapped at room temperature for 1–2 days. Slices freeze well and can be refreshed in a low oven to re-crisp the topping.
