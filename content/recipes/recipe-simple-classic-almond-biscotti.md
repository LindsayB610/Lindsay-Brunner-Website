recipeIngredient:
  - "2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour"
  - "¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar"
  - "1½ tsp baking powder"
  - "¼ tsp fine salt"
  - "4 tbsp (½ stick / 56 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled"

  - "Prep the oven and pan: Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside."
  - "Mix the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until everything looks evenly combined and you don't see any streaks of baking powder."
  - "Stir in butter, extracts, and eggs: Pour in the melted, cooled butter, vanilla extract, and almond extract, plus one of the eggs.

It should feel a little sticky but hold together in a soft ball."
  - "Add the almonds and shape the log: Fold in the chopped roasted almonds and mix with a wooden spoon or your hands until they're evenly distributed. Lightly flour the parchment on your baking sheet. Scrape the dough onto the parchment and, with floured hands, shape it into a long, flat rectangle about 4 inches wide and 14–16 inches long. Aim for an even thickness so it bakes uniformly."
  - "First bake: Bake the log for about 30 minutes, until the surface is lightly golden and just set when you tap it. Transfer the tray to a cooling rack and let the biscotti log cool for 20–25 minutes. You want it cool enough to slice without crumbling but still a bit warm in the center."
  - "Slice and second bake: Keep the oven at 350°F (175°C). Using a serrated knife, carefully slice the log diagonally into pieces about 1 inch thick. Lay the slices cut‑side down on the parchment‑lined sheet in a single layer. Return the tray to the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, flipping the biscotti halfway through so both sides crisp up. They should feel dry at the edges but will firm up even more as they cool. Cool completely on a rack, then try not to eat four in a row \"just to test the texture.\""

Inspired by a Unicorns in the Kitchen TikTok, this is the almond biscotti that accidentally turned into the star of my holiday cookie plate last year. The dough is simple, the slices are sturdy enough to ship in cookie boxes, and the double‑bake turns them into the crisp, dunkable kind of cookie that actually wants to be dropped into your mug.

The secret move from last year's notes: use both almond extract and vanilla extract. Vanilla keeps everything cozy; almond makes the whole kitchen smell like an Italian bakery.

So, let's get started!

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** mixing bowl; whisk or fork; wooden spoon or spatula; rimmed baking sheet; parchment paper; serrated knife; cooling rack (nice but optional)
- **Oven setting:** 350°F (175°C) (first bake 30 minutes; second bake about 10 minutes)
- **Batch size:** About 16 crisp biscotti (depending on how thick you slice)

## Ingredients

### Almond biscotti dough

- 2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp fine salt
- 4 tbsp (½ stick / 56 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ½–1 tsp almond extract (see notes; I like ¾ tsp)
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- ¾ cup (about 90 g) unsalted roasted almonds, roughly chopped

## Method

1. **Prep the oven and pan**

   Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

2. **Mix the dry ingredients**

   In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until everything looks evenly combined and you don't see any streaks of baking powder.

3. **Stir in butter, extracts, and eggs**

   Pour in the melted, cooled butter, vanilla extract, and almond extract, plus one of the eggs. Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until the dough looks mostly combined.

   Add the second egg and mix again until the dough is smooth and thick. It should feel a little sticky but hold together in a soft ball.

4. **Add the almonds and shape the log**

   Fold in the chopped roasted almonds and mix with a wooden spoon or your hands until they're evenly distributed.

   Lightly flour the parchment on your baking sheet. Scrape the dough onto the parchment and, with floured hands, shape it into a long, flat rectangle about 4 inches wide and 14–16 inches long. Aim for an even thickness so it bakes uniformly.

5. **First bake**

   Bake the log for about 30 minutes, until the surface is lightly golden and just set when you tap it.

   Transfer the tray to a cooling rack and let the biscotti log cool for 20–25 minutes. You want it cool enough to slice without crumbling but still a bit warm in the center.

6. **Slice and second bake**

   Keep the oven at 350°F (175°C). Using a serrated knife, carefully slice the log diagonally into pieces about 1 inch thick.

   Lay the slices cut‑side down on the parchment‑lined sheet in a single layer.

   Return the tray to the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, flipping the biscotti halfway through so both sides crisp up. They should feel dry at the edges but will firm up even more as they cool.

   Cool completely on a rack, then try not to eat four in a row "just to test the texture."

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Vanilla + almond extract = the move

The original base recipe used just vanilla, but the best batch I made used both vanilla and almond extract. Almond extract is strong, so ½ tsp gives a gentler flavor; ¾–1 tsp is for people who want that big, marzipan‑adjacent vibe.

### Roasting the almonds

If your almonds aren't already roasted, toast them on a dry sheet pan at 325°F (165°C) for 8–10 minutes, shaking once, until fragrant and just starting to color. Cool before chopping so they don't melt the dough.

### Thickness = texture

Thicker slices (a full 1 inch) give you a slightly softer center after the second bake. Thinner slices will end up crisper all the way through and bake a little faster (start checking around 8 minutes total for the second bake).

### How crunchy do you want them?

For softer biscotti, shave a few minutes off the second bake. For ultra‑crisp, coffee‑shop biscotti, add 3–5 extra minutes, watching that the edges don't darken too much.

### Flavor riffs

Swap the almonds for hazelnuts or pistachios, or fold in a small handful of mini chocolate chips with the nuts. Just keep the total mix‑ins around ¾–1 cup so the dough still holds together.

### Make‑ahead and storage

Biscotti are basically designed for procrastinators. Once fully cooled, they keep in an airtight container at room temperature for at least a week. For longer storage, freeze in a well‑sealed bag; they thaw in minutes and are great straight from the freezer for dunking.
