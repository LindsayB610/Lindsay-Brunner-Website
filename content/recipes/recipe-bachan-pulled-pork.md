  - "Shred and sauce: Shred pork with forks. Moisten with a ladle of the reduced juices until glossy and juicy (usually 1/2 to 3/4 cup). Fold in warmed Bachan's—start with 1/2 cup and add until it tastes right. For extra pop, add a little rice vinegar or a few drops of toasted sesame oil."
  - "Optional bark: Spread sauced pork on a sheet pan and broil 5 to 8 minutes, stirring once, for crispy edges."

I've been trying to use the pressure cooker more (read: remember I own it) and the perfect use case for a pressure cooker, IMO, is pulled pork. Every Sunday we make a batch of something that can be repurposed for weeknight dinners, it's the closest I come to meal prepping, and last Sunday it was this Bachan pulled pork recipe. This was a smash up of several random internet recipes plus my own personal experience, efficiently combined with ChatGPT.

Meet my pressure-braised pork shoulder finished with Bachan's Japanese Barbecue Sauce. The sauce is thin, soy-forward, and punchy, so the trick is to keep the braise clean and sauce after shredding. That keeps the meat juicy (not soupy) and the sauce bright—an approach I cribbed from Kenji's indoor pulled-pork method on [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-oven-baked-pulled-pork-sandwiches).

## Snapshot
- **Implements:** 16-cup (about 4-quart) electric pressure cooker; large bowl; tongs; cutting board; forks for shredding; sheet pan (for optional broil)
- **Cooker setting:** High Pressure 55 minutes, then 15-minute natural release
- **Batch size (safety):** About 3 to 3 1/2 pounds pork shoulder in a 4-quart cooker. Manufacturer guidance: keep total food plus liquid at or below 60% of the pot's capacity and use at least 1/2 cup liquid (I use 1 cup).

## Ingredients

### Japanese-leaning dry rub (no sugar)
- 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 1 1/4 teaspoons Morton's)
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon white or black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional)

### Pressure liquid
- 1 cup water or low-sodium chicken stock
- 1 to 2 tablespoons Bachan's Japanese Barbecue Sauce (optional in-pot flavor boost)
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
- 1 small onion, finely minced (optional)
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil (only if searing)

### To finish
- Bachan's, warmed — start with 1/2 cup, add more to taste (often 3/4 to 1 1/4 cups total)
- Optional: a few drops toasted sesame oil for gloss
- Optional brightener: 1 to 2 teaspoons rice vinegar or a squeeze of lemon or yuzu

### To serve (choose your lane)
- Toasted buns plus sesame slaw and pickles
- Steamed rice plus cucumbers, scallions, nori strips, and a dab of Kewpie
- Lettuce cups plus sesame seeds and chili crisp

## Method
1. **Season (and optionally sear).** Pat pork dry; toss with the dry rub. For extra depth, set the cooker to Sauté, add oil, and quickly brown pork in two batches. Transfer pork out.
2. **Build the base.** If using onion, sauté 2 to 3 minutes. Add water or stock, 1 to 2 tablespoons Bachan's, and rice vinegar; scrape up browned bits.
3. **Cook.** Return pork (and any juices) to the pot. Lock the lid and cook on High Pressure for 55 minutes.
4. **Release.** Let pressure naturally release 15 minutes, then quick-release the remainder.
5. **Reduce and defat.** Transfer pork to a bowl. Skim fat from the pot. Simmer the cooking liquid 5 to 10 minutes to reduce by about one-third.
6. **Shred and sauce.** Shred pork with forks. Moisten with a ladle of the reduced juices until glossy and juicy (usually 1/2 to 3/4 cup). Fold in warmed Bachan's—start with 1/2 cup and add until it tastes right. For extra pop, add a little rice vinegar or a few drops of toasted sesame oil.
7. **Optional bark.** Spread sauced pork on a sheet pan and broil 5 to 8 minutes, stirring once, for crispy edges.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why sauce after?
Indoor pulled pork stays texturally better when the meat and sauce are kept separate until serving. That is straight from Kenji's playbook: braise, shred, then dress only what you will eat now. The rest stores cleaner and reheats juicier.

### Batching safely in a small cooker
A 16-cup (about 4-quart) pot is happiest with roughly 3 to 3 1/2 pounds of shoulder, which keeps you under the 60% fill guideline and above the 1/2-cup minimum liquid. Thick, sugary sauces in the pot can scorch and interfere with pressurizing—use a thin braise and finish with bottled sauce after.

### Flavor tuning for Bachan's
- Want sweeter? Add a spoon of brown sugar to the finishing sauce.
- Want spicier? Stir in chili crisp or a splash of hot sauce.
- Want smokier? A few drops of liquid smoke in the reduced juices (not the bottle) does the trick.

### Make-ahead, freeze, reheat
- Cool fast: Spread pork on a sheet pan 10 to 15 minutes.
- For best quality: Freeze pulled pork for 2 to 3 months; it stays safe longer but gradually dries out past that window.
- Pack smart: Freeze lightly sauced pork in zipper bags with 2 to 3 tablespoons reduced juices per 8-ounce portion; press flat.
- Reheat gently: Covered skillet with a splash of water (or sealed bag in simmering water), then add fresh Bachan's to taste.

### Serving ideas
Sesame-slaw sandwiches, rice bowls with cucumbers and scallions, or lettuce wraps with sesame seeds and chili crisp. If you prefer tangier, Carolina-style vibes on another day, toss a portion with a vinegar-and-pepper sauce instead of Bachan's.

*Hat tip: This pressure-cooker adaptation borrows the "sauce after shredding" logic from Serious Eats' Easy Oven-Cooked Pulled Pork. Different appliance, same principle—better texture and brighter flavor.*
