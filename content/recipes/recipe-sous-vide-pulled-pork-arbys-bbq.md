I used to own a smoker. I wanted to love it, the ritual, the smoke, the promise of perfect pulled pork, but in practice it meant babysitting temperatures for hours and canceling cooks when a Spare the Air day rolled in and ruined the plan. Sous vide fits my life better. This method that I've tested a few times now gives you a tender, shreddable pulled pork without hovering, without smoke, and without reworking your schedule around weather or air-quality alerts.

A long, controlled water bath does the heavy lifting, then a quick broil adds texture and flavor, finished with a tangy-sweet BBQ sauce that leans just a little nostalgic. It's pulled pork for people who want consistency, flexibility, and excellent results, not another thing to monitor all day.

## Ingredients

### Pork and rub

- 3 lb boneless pork shoulder (pork butt), thawed
- 2½ Tsp kosher salt
- 2 Tsp brown sugar
- 1½ Tsp paprika
- 1 Tsp garlic powder
- 1 Tsp onion powder
- ½ Tsp black pepper
- Optional: ½ Tsp mustard powder
- Optional: ½ Tsp ground cumin

### Arby's-leaning BBQ sauce

- 1 cup ketchup
- ½ cup water
- ⅓ cup apple cider vinegar
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 Tbsp yellow mustard
- 1 Tsp onion powder
- 1 Tsp garlic powder
- ½ Tsp paprika
- ¼ Tsp black pepper
- Optional: pinch of cayenne

## Method

1. **Thaw and prep**

   Thaw the pork shoulder completely. Pat it dry. If there is a thick fat cap, trim it down to about ¼ in so you keep richness without blocking seasoning.

2. **Season the pork**

   Mix the rub ingredients. Coat the pork shoulder on all sides. Let it sit for at least 20–30 minutes at room temperature while you set up the water bath (or refrigerate it overnight if you are planning ahead).

3. **Bag it**

   Vacuum seal the pork, or use a heavy freezer bag and the water displacement method. Do not add liquid to the bag. You want concentrated pork juices, not boiled pork vibes.

4. **Sous vide**

   Cook at **165°F (74°C) for 18–24 hours**.

   For a 3 lb boneless shoulder, 20 hours is a great target. Shorter will still work, but you may get slightly chunkier shreds.

5. **Make the BBQ sauce**

   While the pork cooks (or right before serving), combine all sauce ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to maintain a low simmer.

   Simmer uncovered for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until glossy and pourable. Taste and adjust:
   - More tang: add 1–2 Tsp vinegar
   - More sweet: add 1–2 Tsp brown sugar
   - More "Arby's": add ¼–½ Tsp onion powder and an extra ½ Tsp mustard

6. **Broil to finish**

   When the pork is done, remove it from the bag and reserve the juices. Skim off the fat if you feel like it (optional, but helpful if there is a lot).

   Pat the pork very dry and place it on a foil-lined sheet pan. Broil on high for 5–10 minutes total, turning once, until you get browned edges and a little crust.

   Rest 10–15 minutes.

   <p class="image-caption">My last pork shoulder surprised me by being in two pieces when I opened it up, but happily this recipe already handles that well. I just kept the sous vide time to 20 hours and then broiled as normal. Honestly, more surface area is probably a win!</p>

7. **Shred and sauce**

   Shred the pork with two forks (or your hands once it is cool enough). Add a few tablespoons of the reserved juices back into the meat until it tastes richer and more porky.

   Toss with BBQ sauce to taste. Start light, then add more. Pulled pork should taste like pork first and sauce second.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why this method works

Pork shoulder is loaded with connective tissue. Long, steady heat turns collagen into gelatin, which is what makes pulled pork feel silky and moist instead of dry and stringy. Sous vide keeps the meat at a precise temperature long enough to do that conversion without pushing the muscle fibers into full squeeze-out mode.

The broiler step is there for aroma. Browning creates the flavors your brain associates with roasting and barbecue, even if there is no smoker involved.

### Sauce vibe tuning

This sauce is intentionally not smoky. It is tangy, sweet, and onion-forward. That is the "Arby's adjacent" lane.

- For a little more bite: add 1 Tsp prepared horseradish (optional, but very on-theme for roast beef sandwiches)
- For a little more warmth: add ¼ Tsp cayenne or a pinch of white pepper
- For a thicker sauce: simmer 5–10 minutes longer

### If your sauce tastes a bit too sweet after simmering

Balance it by adding a small splash of apple cider vinegar (start with about ½–1 teaspoon), simmer briefly, and taste again. You can also deepen savory balance with a small extra splash of Worcestershire sauce or a pinch of salt to help offset sweetness. Adjust in tiny increments until you reach the flavor you like.

### Storage and reheat

- Refrigerate pulled pork (lightly sauced or unsauced) in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
- Freeze in portions for up to 3 months.
- Reheat gently in a covered skillet with a splash of reserved juices or water, or in the microwave in short bursts, stirring between.

### Pressure cooker shortcut (if you need it later)

You can season, brown, add 1 cup water + 2 Tbsp vinegar, then pressure cook about 60–75 minutes (depending on thickness), natural release, shred, and sauce. Texture will be softer and less "strand-perfect," but still very good.

- Do not skip drying the pork before broiling. Wet meat steams instead of browns.
- Do not add liquid to the sous vide bag. You want concentrated juices, not diluted pork stock.
- Do not sauce heavily before broiling. Sauce burns fast under the broiler.

## Credit where it's due

This recipe is informed by the general Serious Eats approach to sous vide pork shoulder (long cook for collagen conversion, then high-heat finish for browning), adapted to a smaller 3 lb boneless roast and paired with an intentionally fast-food-leaning BBQ sauce profile.
