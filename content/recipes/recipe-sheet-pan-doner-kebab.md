recipeIngredient:
  - "1 lb (about 450 g) ground lamb"
  - "2 lb (about 900 g) 75/25 ground beef"
  - "3 medium yellow onions, peeled and roughly chopped"
  - "1/3 cup plain yoghurt (about 80 g)"
  - "2 tbsp olive oil (use up to 3 tbsp if your meat is leaner)"
  - "1 egg (optional, for a more 'bouncy' hackspieß texture—eggs are explicitly allowed in German döner labeling rules)"
  - "4 tbsp sweet paprika"
  - "1 tsp smoked paprika (optional, more = smokier, less = cleaner)"
  - "1–1.5 tsp pul biber or Aleppo pepper (or 1 tsp regular chili flakes for 'normal,' 1.5 tsp for spicier)"
  - "1.5 tsp freshly ground black pepper"
  - "2 tsp garlic powder"
  - "2 tsp onion powder"
  - "2 tsp dried oregano"
  - "1 tsp dried basil"
  - "1 tsp dried marjoram or thyme"
  - "1 tsp sugar"
  - "2 tbsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 1 tbsp + 3/4 tsp Morton kosher salt), plus more to taste after the test patty"
  - "Juice of 1–2 lemons"
  - "Warm pita or flatbreads"
  - "For Berlin‑style salad: shredded iceberg lettuce, thinly sliced red cabbage, tomato, cucumber, raw onion"
  - "For Bremen‑style: add white cabbage or German‑style krautsalat alongside the red cabbage"
  - "Sauces: garlic sauce (Knoblauchsoße), herb sauce (Kräutersoße), and scharf sauce (see notes for recipes)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Make the onion paste: Add the chopped onions to a food processor and blend until they're paste‑like. If you don't have a processor, grate them on the fine side of a box grater, catching all the juice."
  - "Mix the meat: In a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), combine the lamb, beef, onion paste, yoghurt, olive oil, egg (if using), sweet paprika, smoked paprika (if using), pul biber or Aleppo pepper (or chili flakes), black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, marjoram or thyme, sugar, and the 2 tbsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 1 tbsp + 3/4 tsp Morton kosher salt). For best results—a smooth, homogeneous texture rather than grainy hamburger—use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on low to medium speed for 3–5 minutes, or pulse in a food processor in batches until the mixture is very smooth and paste‑like. If mixing by hand, knead vigorously for 5–7 minutes until the mixture is sticky, cohesive, and no longer feels grainy."
  - "Cook a test patty and adjust seasoning: Pinch off 1–2 tablespoons of the mixture and flatten it into a small patty. Pan‑fry in a lightly oiled skillet over medium to medium‑high heat until cooked through and browned on both sides. Let it cool slightly, then taste. If it tastes flat, add a bit more salt. If you want more heat or spice, bump up the pul biber/Aleppo pepper or chili flakes. Mix any adjustments thoroughly back into the raw meat. If you change things a lot, cook one more mini patty to confirm."
  - "Chill the mixture (optional but helpful): Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30–60 minutes. This firms the mix up and makes it easier to spread thinly, while the flavours settle in."
  - "Preheat the oven: Heat the oven to 400°F / 200°C with a rack in the middle. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment for easier cleanup."
  - "Spread the meat thinly on parchment: Cut several squares or rectangles of parchment, about 10–12 inches across. Working with one sheet at a time, spread a very thin, even layer of meat over the parchment—just a few millimetres thick—leaving a small clean border at the edges so it doesn't squeeze out when you roll."
  - "Roll into tight logs: Starting from one edge, roll the parchment up tightly so the meat forms a compact log inside, like a jelly roll. Twist or fold the ends of the parchment to seal. Repeat with the remaining meat to make 2–4 logs, depending on size. Arrange the logs on the prepared rimmed sheet pan."
  - "First bake: cook through: Roast the logs at 400°F for 20 minutes. They'll firm up and release a good amount of fat."
  - "Drain, second bake, then unwrap and crisp: Carefully remove the pan from the oven and pour off the rendered fat and liquid into a heat‑safe container. Return the pan to the oven and bake for another 15 minutes, until the parchment is turning a deeper brown and the logs feel quite firm when pressed. Take the pan out and carefully unwrap the logs (watch for hot steam). Squeeze the lemon juice over the exposed meat. For extra crispy edges, return the unwrapped logs to the oven for 5–10 more minutes, until the surface is lightly browned in spots."
  - "Rest, slice, and serve: Let the logs rest for about 5 minutes to relax the juices. Using a sharp knife, slice across the logs into thin strips, döner‑style. Pile the meat into warm pita or flatbreads, add salad and sauces, and serve right away."

This is my home‑kitchen take on the classic döner kebab, specifically, the TikTok‑famous "Nefi's Kebab." Instead of a giant rotating cone of meat, you build thin sheets of spiced lamb‑and‑beef mixture on parchment, roll them into logs, and roast them on a sheet pan.

The result: deeply seasoned, juicy strips of kebab you can tuck into pita with salad and sauces, no special equipment required. There's even a tiny "test patty" step so you can lock in the seasoning before you commit three pounds of meat.

## Method

1. **Make the onion paste**

   Add the chopped onions to a food processor and blend until they're paste‑like. If you don't have a processor, grate them on the fine side of a box grater, catching all the juice.

2. **Mix the meat**

   In a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), combine the lamb, beef, onion paste, yoghurt, olive oil, egg (if using), sweet paprika, smoked paprika (if using), pul biber or Aleppo pepper (or chili flakes), black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, marjoram or thyme, sugar, and the 2 tbsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 1 tbsp + 3/4 tsp Morton kosher salt).

   **For best texture:** Use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on low to medium speed for 3–5 minutes, or pulse in a food processor in batches until the mixture is very smooth and paste‑like. The goal is a homogeneous, smooth texture—not grainy like hamburger. If mixing by hand, knead vigorously for 5–7 minutes until the mixture is sticky, cohesive, and no longer feels grainy.

3. **Cook a test patty and adjust seasoning**

   - Pinch off 1–2 tablespoons of the mixture and flatten it into a small patty.
   - Pan‑fry in a lightly oiled skillet over medium to medium‑high heat until cooked through and browned on both sides.
   - Let it cool slightly, then taste. If it tastes flat, add a bit more salt. If you want more heat or spice, bump up the pul biber/Aleppo pepper or chili flakes.
   - Mix any adjustments thoroughly back into the raw meat. If you change things a lot, cook one more mini patty to confirm.

4. **Chill the mixture (optional but helpful)**

   Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30–60 minutes. This firms the mix up and makes it easier to spread thinly, while the flavours settle in.

5. **Preheat the oven**

   Heat the oven to 400°F / 200°C with a rack in the middle. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment for easier cleanup.

6. **Spread the meat thinly on parchment**

   - Cut several squares or rectangles of parchment, about 10–12 inches across.
   - Working with one sheet at a time, spread a very thin, even layer of meat over the parchment—just a few millimetres thick—leaving a small clean border at the edges so it doesn't squeeze out when you roll.

7. **Roll into tight logs**

   - Starting from one edge, roll the parchment up tightly so the meat forms a compact log inside, like a jelly roll.
   - Twist or fold the ends of the parchment to seal.
   - Repeat with the remaining meat to make 2–4 logs, depending on size.
   - Arrange the logs on the prepared rimmed sheet pan.

8. **First bake: cook through**

   Roast the logs at 400°F for 20 minutes. They'll firm up and release a good amount of fat.

9. **Drain, second bake, then unwrap and crisp**

   - Carefully remove the pan from the oven and pour off the rendered fat and liquid into a heat‑safe container.
   - Return the pan to the oven and bake for another 15 minutes, until the parchment is turning a deeper brown and the logs feel quite firm when pressed.
   - Take the pan out and carefully unwrap the logs (watch for hot steam).
   - Squeeze the lemon juice over the exposed meat.
   - For extra crispy edges, return the unwrapped logs to the oven for 5–10 more minutes, until the surface is lightly browned in spots.

10. **Rest, slice, and serve**

    Let the logs rest for about 5 minutes to relax the juices. Using a sharp knife, slice across the logs into thin strips, döner‑style.

    Pile the meat into warm pita or flatbreads, add salad and sauces, and serve right away.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Meat choices
- Lamb + high‑fat beef gives a very juicy, kebab‑shop style result. If you prefer something lighter, you can swap in leaner beef and add a bit more olive oil to keep things moist.
- All‑beef works fine; just keep the total fat around 20–25% so the meat doesn't dry out in the oven.

### Heat and spice tuning
- This is a Berlin/Bremen‑ish spice blend (cumin‑free). The sugar echoes the mild sweetness found in many German spice mixes and sauces.
- For heat: Use 1 tsp pul biber or Aleppo pepper (or regular chili flakes) for "normal" heat, or 1.5 tsp for spicier. Pul biber and Aleppo pepper give a more complex, fruity heat than regular chili flakes.
- Smoked paprika is optional—use more for a smokier profile, less (or none) for a cleaner taste. Adjust to taste after the test patty.

### Berlin/Bremen toppings & sauces
The meat can be 95% right and still "not taste like Berlin" if the sauces and salads are off. The "herb + garlic + scharf trinity" is very specifically Berlin, and Bremen slots right in culturally but with more willingness to throw cocktail/tzatziki into the mix.

**Salad bar:**
- **German-style:** Iceberg lettuce (shredded), red cabbage (thinly sliced), tomato & cucumber, raw onion. Avoid white cabbage and krautsalat if you're chasing Berlin classic; those show up more in Bremen/Niedersachsen.

**Speed‑run sauces (home kitchen versions):**
These are simplified but hit the right lane for classic Berlin döner.

- **Garlic (Knoblauchsoße):** ½ cup mayo + ½ cup thick yoghurt (Greek or strained) + 2–3 cloves garlic (finely grated) + pinch of salt + squeeze of lemon

- **Herb (Kräutersoße):** Same base (½ cup mayo + ½ cup yoghurt) + 1–2 tsp dried mixed herbs (parsley + dill + chives/"pizza herbs" style) + salt + tiny pinch of sugar + splash of lemon or a drop of vinegar

- **Scharf (curry‑ketchupy style):** 3 tbsp ketchup + 1–2 tsp chili flakes or chili powder + ½ tsp mild curry powder + tiny splash of vinegar or lemon + pinch of sugar if needed

### Texture and mixing
- **Mechanical mixing is key:** Using a stand mixer or food processor to mix the meat creates a smooth, homogeneous texture that's essential for authentic döner kebab. Hand mixing can leave the texture grainy and hamburger‑like. If you must mix by hand, knead very vigorously for at least 5–7 minutes until the mixture feels smooth and paste‑like.
- **Optional egg binder:** Adding 1 egg creates a more "bouncy" hackspieß texture—eggs are explicitly allowed as part of döner mixtures in German labeling rules.
- The thinner you spread the meat before rolling, the more distinct the layers and the easier it is to slice into nice ribbons. Thick sheets will feel more like a meatloaf.

### Make‑ahead
- You can mix the meat and park it in the fridge, covered, for up to 24 hours before baking. The flavours deepen a bit, and the mixture firms up nicely.
- Baked logs can be cooled, wrapped, and refrigerated. Slice and reheat in a skillet or in a hot oven for quick weeknight kebab.

### Storage and reheat
- Store leftover sliced meat in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
- Reheat in a hot nonstick skillet to re‑crisp the edges, or spread on a sheet pan and warm at 375°F / 190°C until sizzling.
- The leftovers are excellent in rice bowls, salads, quesadillas, or on top of fries if you're living your best late‑night life.
