recipeIngredient:
  - "16 oz box ditalini (or small shells / elbows)"
  - "~1 lb butternut squash, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes (fresh or frozen, see note)"
  - "2 Tbsp olive oil"
  - "½ tsp kosher salt (to start)"
  - "2–3 sprigs fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried thyme)"
  - "8–12 fresh sage leaves or ½ tsp dried ground sage (if using dried, skip frying step below)"
  - "~3.5 oz guanciale, cut into small cubes (see rendering note)"
  - "2 cloves garlic, minced or grated"
  - "1 Tbsp tomato paste (for depth and color in the sauce)"
  - "¾ cup heavy cream"
  - "¾ cup whole-milk ricotta"
  - "½–¾ cup finely grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano"
  - "Black pepper, to taste"
  - "Optional: lemon zest or a small squeeze of lemon juice (for brightness at finish)"
  - "Optional: 1–1½ cups frozen peas"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Roast the squash: Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss the butternut squash cubes with olive oil, thyme, and the ½ tsp salt. Spread on a sheet pan in a single layer. Roast 20–28 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the edges begin to caramelize and the centers are soft."
  - "Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the full 16 oz of ditalini and boil until al dente. Reserve 1½ cups of pasta water (you'll likely use about ½–1 cup), then drain the pasta."
  - "Render the guanciale: Place the cubed guanciale in a cold skillet and turn heat to low. Let it slowly render for 10–15 minutes until the fat melts out and the guanciale pieces are crisp. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the crispy guanciale to a paper-towel lined plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Slow rendering gives the best texture and flavor (don't rush it)."
  - "Fry the sage (if using fresh): Add the fresh sage leaves to the hot guanciale fat. Fry for 30–60 seconds until crisp, then remove and set aside. If using dried sage instead, skip this frying step and add the dried sage later with the sauce."
  - "Build the sauce base: Stir garlic and tomato paste into the guanciale fat. Cook 1–2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant and the tomato paste deepens in color."
  - "Add squash and build texture: Add the roasted squash to the pan. Lightly mash a portion of the cubes so the sauce becomes partly creamy, partly chunky."
  - "Add cream, ricotta, cheese: Pour in the heavy cream, then stir in ricotta and half of the grated Parmesan (or Romano). If using dried sage, add it here so it has a chance to bloom in the warm sauce. Stir until smooth and combined."
  - "Adjust sauce consistency: Add reserved pasta water a little at a time, stirring, until the sauce becomes saucy and glossy (enough to coat pasta but not pool). Usually ½–1 cup pasta water will do."
  - "Combine pasta and sauce: Add the cooked ditalini to the sauce and toss thoroughly. If using frozen peas, stir in 1–1½ cups and let them warm through for 2–3 minutes, just until bright green and tender. Taste now. Because guanciale, cheese, and pasta water already bring salt, you may only need a small pinch. Add black pepper generously. If the sauce tastes too rich or heavy, brighten with lemon zest or a splash of lemon juice."
  - "Finish and serve: Divide pasta among bowls. Top each portion with crispy guanciale, crisped sage leaves (if fresh), and a sprinkle of remaining Parmesan. Serve immediately."

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** sheet pan, large pot, skillet, mixing spoon, sharp knife, wooden spoon
- **Oven setting:** 425°F / 220°C for roasting squash
- **Batch size:** ~5–6 main-dish servings (4 generous servings)
- **Pasta cooked separately for reliable texture**

## Ingredients

- 16 oz box ditalini (or small shells / elbows)
- ~1 lb butternut squash, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes (fresh or frozen, see note)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- ½ tsp kosher salt (to start)
- 2–3 sprigs fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried thyme)
- 8–12 fresh sage leaves or ½ tsp dried ground sage (if using dried, skip frying step below)
- ~3.5 oz guanciale, cut into small cubes (see rendering note)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
- 1 Tbsp tomato paste (for depth and color in the sauce)
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- ¾ cup whole-milk ricotta
- ½–¾ cup finely grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano
- Black pepper, to taste
- Optional: lemon zest or a small squeeze of lemon juice (for brightness at finish)
- Optional: 1–1½ cups frozen peas

## Method

1. **Roast the squash**

   Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss the butternut squash cubes with olive oil, thyme, and the ½ tsp salt. Spread on a sheet pan in a single layer. Roast 20–28 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the edges begin to caramelize and the centers are soft.

   **If using frozen cubed butternut squash:** Roast straight from frozen. Increase oven temp to 450°F and cook 18–25 minutes, tossing once. Frozen squash releases more water, so it browns more slowly. Roast until any liquid evaporates and the edges pick up color. Texture will be slightly softer, which actually blends beautifully into the sauce.

2. **Cook the pasta**

   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the full 16 oz of ditalini and boil until al dente. Reserve 1½ cups of pasta water (you'll likely use about ½–1 cup), then drain the pasta.

3. **Render the guanciale**

   Place the cubed guanciale in a cold skillet and turn heat to low. Let it slowly render for 10–15 minutes until the fat melts out and the guanciale pieces are crisp. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the crispy guanciale to a paper-towel lined plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Slow rendering gives the best texture and flavor (don't rush it).

4. **Fry the sage (if using fresh)**

   Add the fresh sage leaves to the hot guanciale fat. Fry for 30–60 seconds until crisp, then remove and set aside. If using dried sage instead, skip this frying step and add the dried sage later with the sauce.

5. **Build the sauce base**

   Stir garlic and tomato paste into the guanciale fat. Cook 1–2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant and the tomato paste deepens in color.

6. **Add squash and build texture**

   Add the roasted squash to the pan. Lightly mash a portion of the cubes so the sauce becomes partly creamy, partly chunky.

7. **Add cream, ricotta, cheese**

   Pour in the heavy cream, then stir in ricotta and half of the grated Parmesan (or Romano). If using dried sage, add it here so it has a chance to bloom in the warm sauce. Stir until smooth and combined.

8. **Adjust sauce consistency**

   Add reserved pasta water a little at a time, stirring, until the sauce becomes saucy and glossy (enough to coat pasta but not pool). Usually ½–1 cup pasta water will do.

9. **Combine pasta and sauce**

   Add the cooked ditalini to the sauce and toss thoroughly. If using frozen peas, stir them in now and let them warm through for 2–3 minutes, just until bright green and tender. Taste now. Because guanciale, cheese, and pasta water already bring salt, you may only need a small pinch. Add black pepper generously. If the sauce tastes too rich or heavy, brighten with lemon zest or a splash of lemon juice.

10. **Finish and serve**

    Divide pasta among bowls. Top each portion with crispy guanciale, crisped sage leaves (if fresh), and a sprinkle of remaining Parmesan. Serve immediately.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Fresh vs frozen squash

If using frozen cubed butternut squash: there's no need to thaw. Spread the frozen cubes on a sheet pan and roast at 450°F for about 18–25 minutes, tossing once halfway through. Frozen squash holds more water and browns more slowly, so the higher heat helps with caramelization. Watch for extra liquid on the pan. Roast until it evaporates and the edges begin to color. The texture will be a bit softer than fresh, which actually helps the sauce become creamy.

### Guanciale rendering matters

Starting guanciale in a cold pan and rendering slowly over low heat brings out rich pork-cheek flavor and yields crisp, glassy bites. High heat risks overcooking or burning.

### Herb options

If you don't have fresh herbs, dried thyme and sage work, but dried sage can taste bitter if overheated. That's why dried sage goes in with the sauce, while fresh sage gets a quick crisp fry for flavor and texture.

### Salt carefully

Because guanciale, cheese, and pasta water all contribute salt, you want to start light. Taste after combining pasta and sauce and before seasoning again.

### Brighten it up

A little lemon zest or a splash of lemon juice at the end cuts through the richness and brings freshness (especially nice if you lean heavy on cream and cheese).
