recipeIngredient:
  - "1¼ pounds sweet potatoes (about 2 medium–large), peeled and cut into 1‑inch chunks"
  - "3 tablespoons salted butter, softened"
  - "⅓ cup packed light brown sugar"
  - "2 tablespoons heavy cream or half‑and‑half (only add more if the mash looks stiff)"
  - "½ teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, but nice)"
  - "¼–½ teaspoon kosher salt (use the higher end if your butter is unsalted)"
  - "Tiny pinch cinnamon (about ⅛ teaspoon, optional – keep it subtle)"
  - "½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans"
  - "¼ cup (4 tablespoons) all‑purpose flour"
  - "2 tablespoons softened (not melted) butter"
  - "⅓ cup packed light brown sugar"
  - "Pinch kosher salt"
  - "1–2 tablespoons rolled oats or panko (optional, for extra crunch/insurance)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Cook the sweet potatoes: Add the sweet potato chunks to a pot, cover with cold water by about an inch, and salt the water. Bring to a boil, then simmer 12–15 minutes, until the potatoes are very tender. Drain well and let them sit in the warm pot for 2–3 minutes to steam off excess moisture."
  - "Preheat and prep the pan: Heat the oven to 350°F / 175°C. Lightly butter a small 1‑quart baking dish (shallow pans brown better; aim for about 1 inch deep)."
  - "Whip the base until fluffy: Transfer the hot potatoes to a mixing bowl. Add the softened butter, brown sugar, salt, vanilla, and cinnamon (if using). Use a hand mixer on medium (or a very energetic whisk) to beat the potatoes until smooth and slightly airy, 1–2 minutes. Beat in the cream (2 tablespoons max; only add more if the mash looks stiff) until the mixture is loose and fluffy like soft mashed potatoes, not runny. Taste and adjust salt or sugar. Scrape the whipped sweet potatoes into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top gently without pressing out too much air. Let it sit 5 minutes so it's not hot enough to melt the topping instantly."
  - "Make the nut topping: In a small bowl, toss the nuts, flour, sugar, and salt. Rub in the softened butter with your fingers or a fork until pebbly crumbs form. If using, stir in the rolled oats or panko. Chill 10 minutes so the butter firms up."
  - "Assemble and bake: Sprinkle the chilled nut mixture evenly over the sweet potatoes. Bake on the upper‑middle rack at 350°F until bubbling at the edges. To finish, increase to 400°F for 5 minutes or give it a short broil to brown the sugars."
  - "Rest and serve scoop‑style: Let the casserole rest 10–15 minutes so it thickens slightly but stays soft and scoopable. Serve warm, using an ice‑cream scoop or large spoon to portion into bowls. Expect 3–4 generous side servings."

This is my best recreation of the sweet potato casserole from [Sauced BBQ](https://www.saucedbbqandspirits.com) in Lafayette, CA: fluffy, buttery sweet potatoes baked in a pan, then scooped out with an ice‑cream scoop and crowned with a chunky brown‑sugar nut crumble. It eats like dessert but absolutely belongs next to brisket.

## Snapshot
- **Implements:** medium pot; colander; mixing bowl; hand mixer (or sturdy whisk); rubber spatula; loaf pan or similar
- **Oven setting:** 350°F / 175°C on upper‑middle rack until bubbling at edges, then 400°F for 5 minutes or short broil to finish
- **Batch size:** about 3–4 BBQ‑style side servings; doubles cleanly for a 9×9 pan

## Method

1. **Cook the sweet potatoes.**

   Add the sweet potato chunks to a pot, cover with cold water by about an inch, and salt the water. Bring to a boil, then simmer 12–15 minutes, until the potatoes are very tender. Drain well and let them sit in the warm pot for 2–3 minutes to steam off excess moisture.

2. **Preheat and prep the pan.**

   Heat the oven to 350°F / 175°C. Lightly butter a small 1‑quart baking dish (shallow pans brown better; aim for about 1 inch deep).

3. **Whip the base until fluffy.**

   Transfer the hot potatoes to a mixing bowl. Add the softened butter, brown sugar, salt, vanilla, and cinnamon (if using).

   Use a hand mixer on medium (or a very energetic whisk) to beat the potatoes until smooth and slightly airy, 1–2 minutes. Beat in the cream (2 tablespoons max; only add more if the mash looks stiff) until the mixture is loose and fluffy like soft mashed potatoes, not runny. Taste and adjust salt or sugar.

   Scrape the whipped sweet potatoes into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top gently without pressing out too much air. Let it sit 5 minutes so it's not hot enough to melt the topping instantly.

4. **Make the nut topping.**

   In a small bowl, toss the nuts, flour, sugar, and salt. Rub in the softened butter with your fingers or a fork until pebbly crumbs form. If using, stir in the rolled oats or panko. Chill 10 minutes so the butter firms up.

   (Optional: Pre‑toast the nuts at 350°F for 5–7 minutes if you want extra color and less moisture.)

5. **Assemble and bake.**

   Sprinkle the chilled nut mixture evenly over the sweet potatoes.

   Bake on the upper‑middle rack at 350°F until bubbling at the edges. To finish, increase to 400°F for 5 minutes or give it a short broil to brown the sugars.

6. **Rest and serve scoop‑style.**

   Let the casserole rest 10–15 minutes so it thickens slightly but stays soft and scoopable. Serve warm, using an ice‑cream scoop or large spoon to portion into bowls. Expect 3–4 generous side servings.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why whip instead of bake with eggs?

Whipping the potatoes with butter and a bit of cream (and skipping eggs) keeps the base light and fluffy even after baking. It won't set into a firm slice like a custard; it stays soft enough to scoop from a larger pan, just like the restaurant version.

### Walnuts vs. pecans

Use whichever nut you like more:

- Walnuts lean a little earthier and are very close to what some menus list.
- Pecans skew sweeter and more classic "sweet potato casserole."

Either way, keep the pieces on the chunky side so the topping has texture.

### Sweetness and spice tuning

- For a more dessert‑y vibe, bump the brown sugar in the base up to a scant ½ cup.
- For a less sweet side, drop the base sugar to ¼ cup and leave the topping as‑is.
- Cinnamon is optional; keep it to a tiny pinch so the casserole reads as "sweet potato + brown sugar + nuts," not pumpkin pie.

### Make‑ahead and reheat

You can assemble the casserole earlier in the day:

- Assemble completely, cover, and refrigerate.
- Bake straight from the fridge at 350°F, adding 5–10 extra minutes until hot and bubbling.
- Leftovers reheat nicely in the oven (covered) or microwave; they'll be softer but still very scoopable.

### Scaling up for a crowd

For a 9×13 pan that feeds a small army:

- Double everything.
- Expect a bake time closer to 30–35 minutes, until the topping is browned and the center is hot.
- Hold warm and scoop to order next to brisket, pulled pork, or whatever barbecue situation you've engineered.

### Why this topping works

Typical streusel wants a leaner butter ratio (by weight, butter ≤ sugar and flour combined). The original mix (melted butter + little flour) acted like a glaze and stayed glossy. More flour + softened butter + brief chilling = distinct crumbs that brown and crisp instead of swimming. This shifts the ratio toward dry/binder so the sugar can caramelize instead of frying in butter.
