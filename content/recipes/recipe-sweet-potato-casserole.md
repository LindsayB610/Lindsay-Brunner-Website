recipeIngredient:
  - "1¼–1½ pounds sweet potatoes (565–680 g), peeled and cut into 1‑inch chunks"
  - "3 tablespoons salted butter, softened"
  - "2–4 tablespoons heavy cream or half‑and‑half, to loosen"
  - "½ teaspoon kosher salt"
  - "1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (115–120 g)"
  - "⅓ cup packed light brown sugar (67 g)"
  - "1 tablespoon all‑purpose flour (8 g; use 2 Tbsp/16 g for a more crumbly, less nut‑forward top)"
  - "2 tablespoons softened (not melted) butter (28 g)"
  - "Pinch kosher salt"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Prep & toast the nuts: Heat oven to 350°F / 175°C. Spread chopped nuts on a sheet pan and toast 6–8 minutes until just fragrant and a shade deeper. Cool completely (warm nuts will melt the streusel butter)."
  - "Cook the sweet potatoes: Put chunks in a pot, cover with cold water by ~1 inch, salt the water. Bring to a boil, then simmer 12–15 minutes until very tender. Drain thoroughly and let sit in the hot pot 2–3 minutes to steam off excess moisture."
  - "Preheat and prep the pan: Lightly butter a 1‑quart baking dish (~4‑cup volume; fills ~⅔ up the sides)."
  - "Whip the base (precise cream‑mixing sequence): Start the whip without cream: Move the hot potatoes to a mixing bowl. Add softened butter and salt. Beat on low–medium for 30–60 seconds until mostly smooth and beginning to look fluffy. Scrape the bowl. Add cream gradually: With the mixer on low, add cream 1 Tbsp at a time, beating 10–15 seconds after each addition. Stop when the texture is like soft mashed potatoes—peaks slump slowly, not runny. (Small pan usually needs 2–4 Tbsp.) Final aeration: Bump speed to medium for 20–30 seconds to add a little air. Taste for salt. Pan & cool: Spread into your pan, smoothing gently (don't press the air out). Cool 5 minutes so the topping won't melt on contact."
  - "Make the topping: In a bowl, combine brown sugar, flour, salt, and the cooled toasted nuts. Rub in the softened butter with fingers/fork until pebbly clumps form. Chill 10 minutes so the crumbs hold their shape."
  - "Assemble & bake: Blanket the potatoes with the topping. Bake on the upper‑middle rack at 350°F until the edges bubble and the top looks set (1‑quart dish: 20–25 minutes)."
  - "Finish & serve: Increase to 400°F for 3–6 minutes (or a short broil) to brown the sugars. Rest 10 minutes, then scoop with a disher into warm bowls."

This version keeps the potatoes buttery and lightly salted, with all the sweetness living in a chunky brown‑sugar nut topping. It bakes in a pan and gets scooped with a disher—just like the restaurant version from [Sauced BBQ](https://www.saucedbbqandspirits.com) in Lafayette, CA.

## Snapshot
- **Implements:** medium pot; colander; mixing bowl; hand mixer (or very sturdy whisk); rubber spatula; sheet pan; 9×5 loaf pan (hotel‑pan vibe) or 1‑quart baking dish
- **Oven:** 350°F / 175°C for 20–30 minutes, then finish at 400°F for 3–6 minutes
- **Batch size:** see "Choose your pan & base amounts" below

## Ingredients

### Choose your pan & base amounts

**A) 9×5 loaf pan (~8‑cup volume), fills ~⅔ up the sides**

(yields ~6–8 BBQ‑style side servings; ~5–5½ cups whipped base)

- Sweet potatoes: 2½–2¾ lb (1.1–1.25 kg), peeled, 1‑inch chunks
- Salted butter: 5 Tbsp (70 g), softened
- Heavy cream or half‑and‑half: 3–6 Tbsp (45–90 ml), to loosen
- Kosher salt: ¾ tsp (use a bit less if your butter is very salty)

**B) 1‑quart baking dish (~4‑cup volume), fills ~⅔ up the sides**

(yields ~3–4 side servings; ~3½–4 cups whipped base)

- Sweet potatoes: 1¼–1½ lb (565–680 g), peeled, 1‑inch chunks
- Salted butter: 3 Tbsp (42 g), softened
- Heavy cream or half‑and‑half: 2–4 Tbsp (30–60 ml), to loosen
- Kosher salt: ½ tsp

**Base is savory. No sugar, no cinnamon, no vanilla—sweetness is only in the topping.**

### Toasted nut topping (nut‑forward; browns reliably)

- Chopped walnuts or pecans: 1 cup (115–120 g) — toast first
- Light brown sugar: ⅓ cup (67 g)
- All‑purpose flour: 1 Tbsp (8 g) (use 2 Tbsp/16 g for a more crumbly, less nut‑forward top)
- Softened butter: 2 Tbsp (28 g) (softened, not melted)
- Kosher salt: pinch

## Method

1. **Prep & toast the nuts.**

   Heat oven to 350°F / 175°C. Spread chopped nuts on a sheet pan and toast 6–8 minutes until just fragrant and a shade deeper. Cool completely (warm nuts will melt the streusel butter).

2. **Cook the sweet potatoes.**

   Put chunks in a pot, cover with cold water by ~1 inch, salt the water. Bring to a boil, then simmer 12–15 minutes until very tender. Drain thoroughly and let sit in the hot pot 2–3 minutes to steam off excess moisture.

   **2b. Optional dry‑out (for fluffier texture):** After draining, either (a) spread the hot chunks on a sheet pan and dry in a low oven (convection 250°F 8–12 min; no convection 275°F 8–12 min) just until the surfaces look matte—no browning—or (b) return to the empty pot over low–medium heat and stir 1–3 minutes until steamy and dry to the touch. Proceed to whipping. You may need +1–2 Tbsp cream to reach soft‑peak fluff.

3. **Whip the base (precise cream‑mixing sequence).**

   - **3a. Start the whip without cream:** Move the hot potatoes to a mixing bowl. Add softened butter and salt. Beat on low–medium for 30–60 seconds until mostly smooth and beginning to look fluffy. Scrape the bowl.

   - **3b. Add cream gradually:** With the mixer on low, add cream 1 Tbsp at a time, beating 10–15 seconds after each addition. Stop when the texture is like soft mashed potatoes—peaks slump slowly, not runny. (Small pan usually needs 2–4 Tbsp; loaf pan 3–6 Tbsp.)

   - **3c. Final aeration:** Bump speed to medium for 20–30 seconds to add a little air. Taste for salt.

   - **3d. Pan & cool:** Spread into your pan, smoothing gently (don't press the air out). Cool 5 minutes so the topping won't melt on contact.

4. **Make the topping.**

   In a bowl, combine brown sugar, flour, salt, and the cooled toasted nuts. Rub in the softened butter with fingers/fork until pebbly clumps form. Chill 10 minutes so the crumbs hold their shape.

5. **Assemble & bake.**

   Blanket the potatoes with the topping. Bake on the upper‑middle rack until the edges bubble and the top looks set:

   - 1‑quart dish: 20–25 minutes
   - 9×5 loaf pan: 25–30 minutes

6. **Finish & serve.**

   Increase to 400°F for 3–6 minutes (or a short broil) to brown the sugars. Rest 10 minutes, then scoop with a disher into warm bowls.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why whip instead of bake with eggs?

Whipping the potatoes with butter and a bit of cream (and skipping eggs) keeps the base light and fluffy even after baking. It won't set into a firm slice like a custard; it stays soft enough to scoop from a larger pan, just like the restaurant version.

### Walnuts vs. pecans

Use whichever nut you like more:

- Walnuts lean a little earthier and are very close to what some menus list.
- Pecans skew sweeter and more classic "sweet potato casserole."

Either way, keep the pieces on the chunky side so the topping has texture.

### All sweetness up top

- If using dark brown sugar, add +1 tsp flour to the topping to keep crumbs distinct.
- Extra crunch insurance: Add 1–2 Tbsp panko or rolled oats to the topping.
- Pan height target: The weights above give ~⅔‑full in each pan before topping; that's the right visual for a generous scoop.
- If the top looks glossy at 15–18 minutes: Lightly dust 1–2 tsp flour over shiny patches and finish on the top rack.

### Make‑ahead and reheat

You can assemble the casserole earlier in the day:

- Assemble completely, cover, and refrigerate.
- Bake straight from the fridge at 350°F, adding 5–10 extra minutes until hot and bubbling.
- Leftovers reheat nicely in the oven (covered) or microwave; they'll be softer but still very scoopable.

### Change log (what's different from earlier drafts)

- Base is now savory: removed added sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla.
- Butter in the base reduced to 3 Tbsp (1‑qt) or 5 Tbsp (9×5) to avoid weeping.
- Cream‑mixing clarified: brief whip with butter/salt first, then add cream 1 Tbsp at a time while mixing on low; finish with a short medium‑speed aeration.
- Fill height fixed: increased potato weight for 9×5 (2½–2¾ lb) to reach ~⅔; included 1‑qt option for a smaller batch at the same depth.
- Nut topping rebalanced: more nuts (1 cup), less flour (1 Tbsp default), softened (not melted) butter, and a 10‑minute chill so crumbs brown instead of melting.
- Toasting required: nuts are pre‑toasted 6–8 minutes for real nuttiness and better crunch.
- Browning finish: added a 400°F, 3–6 minute finish (or brief broil) for color.
