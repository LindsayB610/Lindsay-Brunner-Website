OK, I'm not too proud to admit it... I really really love Wendy's chili. It's absolute comfort food, especially when piled on the most perfect of vessels, a Wendy's baked potato, or even better, Wendy's fries. But I digress...

This week I set out to make a pot of chili at home with Wendy's vibes and just ingredients I already had on hand. My good bud Chatty G helped me make it work with my freezer and pantry staples (San Marzanos, hatch chiles, duck fat, smoked salt... be jealous). It leans into slow simmered flavor without being fussy. It is hearty, rich, a little smoky, and very very IYKYK. Serves 6 to 8.

### Spices

### Finishers
- 1 cup frozen corn
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 quarter teaspoon smoked salt to start
- optional 1 teaspoon European butter for a silky finish

## Method

1. **Brown the beef**

Place the ground beef in a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Cook until well browned, breaking it up as it cooks. Lightly season with salt.

2. **Drain most of the rendered fat**

Pour off excess fat, leaving behind about 1 to 2 teaspoons.

3. **Add duck fat and aromatics**

Add the duck fat to the pot. Stir in onion, garlic, carrot and celery. Cook 5 to 7 minutes until softened.

4. **Add peppers and hatch chiles**

Stir in bell peppers and drained hatch chiles. Cook 3 to 4 minutes.

5. **Bloom the spices**

Add chili powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne, Italian seasoning, sugar and black pepper. Stir and let the spices bloom in the fat for 30 to 45 seconds.

6. **Add tomato paste**

Stir in the tomato paste and cook 1 minute to deepen the base.

7. **Add tomatoes**

Add the crushed San Marzanos and all their juices.

8. **Build the broth**

Add rinsed beans, water or broth, Worcestershire, molasses or maple syrup and chili crisp. Stir well.

9. **Simmer**

Bring to a gentle bubble, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 45 to 60 minutes. Add more water if it thickens too much. If it is too thin, simmer uncovered during the last 15 minutes.

10. **Add frozen corn**

Stir in the corn during the last 10 minutes so it stays bright.

11. **Finish and season**

Taste and adjust. Add lemon juice, then add smoked salt a little at a time until the flavor feels round and balanced. Add a teaspoon of butter if you want a silky finish. Adjust salt, pepper or heat as needed.

## Notes, swaps and guardrails

The dairy-free label applies to the base recipe; the optional butter adds dairy.

### Duck fat note
If you don't have duck fat, just retain more beef drippings!

### If the chili tastes flat
Adjust salt first. Then try another small pinch of smoked salt. Then a drop or two more Worcestershire. Save lemon juice for the very end.

### If the chili tastes too acidic
Add a tiny amount of molasses or a pinch of sugar. Do not increase the lemon.

### If the chili is too thick
Add water a splash at a time until it loosens to a scoopable texture.

### If it is too thin
Simmer uncovered until it tightens.
