  - "1¾ cups (200 g) finely grated carrots"
  - "1 cup (100 g) ground almonds or almond flour"
  - "½ cup (60 g) all-purpose flour"
  - "¾ cup (150 g) sugar"
  - "4 large eggs, separated"
  - "½ cup (120 ml) neutral oil (avocado oil works well)"
  - "1½ Tsp baking powder"
  - "1 Tsp ground cinnamon"
  - "¼ Tsp ground nutmeg"
  - "¼ Tsp fine kosher salt"
  - "Zest of 1 lemon, very finely grated"
  - "1 Tsp vanilla extract"
  - "1 cup (120 g) confectioners' sugar"
  - "1 Tbsp water"
  - "2 to 3 drops almond extract"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Prepare the pan and oven. Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 9×5-inch loaf pan with parchment, leaving overhang on the long sides. Lightly grease any exposed pan."
  - "Mix the yolk base. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and slightly thickened. Whisk in the oil, vanilla, and lemon zest."
  - "Add carrots and dry ingredients. Stir the grated carrots into the yolk mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the ground almonds, flour, baking powder, spices, and kosher salt, then fold into the batter just until combined."
  - "Whip and fold the egg whites. Beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Fold them into the batter in two additions, using a light hand to preserve air."
  - "Bake the loaf. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, filling no more than ¾ full. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven to 325°F (165°C) and bake for the remainder (about 50 to 60 minutes more; 65 to 75 minutes total). At about 40 minutes total, loosely tent the loaf with foil if the top is browning faster than the center."
  - "Cool completely. When a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with only moist crumbs and the loaf springs back when pressed, remove from the oven. Cool in the pan for 25 to 30 minutes, then turn out and cool completely before glazing."
  - "Make the glaze. Whisk the confectioners' sugar, water, almond extract, and a pinch of kosher salt until thick, opaque, and spoonable."
  - "Glaze and set. Spoon the glaze down the center of the fully cooled loaf and gently encourage it outward. Let the glaze set uncovered at room temperature until matte and crackable."

So, my kid eats a lot of carrots. Probably 1-2 a day. Last weekend,  my local Safeway was out of carrots in every format, except for 5lb bags, so of course I bought a 5lb bag, He's six, so I have a real fear that a week without carrots might mean he decides he hates carrots now. If you're thinking that makes no logical sense, you're right, and also you've clearly never tried to feed a six-year-old. 

Fast forward to Friday and I have approximately 72 aging carrots in my vegetable drawer that are getting bendier by the day. Rationally, it is time to make carrot cake. My go-to recipe from Dorie Greenspan makes a very large three layer cake, which would certainly be great for using up all the carrots, but would also be great for wasting a bunch of other ingredients since my small family would never be able to finish the whole thing. Thus, this German-style carrot and almond torte was adapted to behave properly in a loaf pan. 

Bonus points that it's dairy free, contains some protein, and doesn't require that I mess with cream cheese. The crack-set almond glaze gives you structure and texture without frosting-level sweetness.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** 9×5-inch loaf pan; parchment paper; mixing bowls; whisk; hand or stand mixer; rubber spatula; box or paddle grater; microplane or zester (for lemon)
- **Oven setting:** 350°F (175°C) for 15 minutes, then 325°F (165°C) for the remainder; center rack
- **Batch size:** one 9×5 loaf

## Ingredients

### Cake batter

- 1¾ cups (200 g) finely grated carrots
- 1 cup (100 g) almond flour
- ½ cup (60 g) all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup (150 g) sugar
- 4 large eggs, separated
- ½ cup (120 ml) neutral oil (avocado oil works well)
- 1½ Tsp baking powder
- 1 Tsp ground cinnamon
- ¼ Tsp ground nutmeg
- ¼ Tsp kosher salt
- Zest of 1 lemon, very finely grated
- 1 Tsp vanilla extract

### Sweet almond glaze

- 1 cup (120 g) confectioners' sugar
- 1 Tbsp water
- 2 to 3 drops almond extract
- Pinch of kosher salt

## Method

1. **Prepare the pan and oven**

   Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 9×5-inch loaf pan with parchment, leaving overhang on the long sides for easy removal. Lightly grease any exposed pan.

2. **Grate the carrots**

   Grate the carrots on the fine side of a box or paddle grater until you have 1¾ cups (200 g). Set aside.

3. **Build the yolk base**

   In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and slightly thickened. Whisk in the oil, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. Stir the grated carrots into the yolk mixture.

4. **Add dry ingredients**

   In a separate bowl, mix the almond flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, spices, and kosher salt. Fold the dry ingredients into the batter just until combined.

5. **Whip and fold the egg whites**

   Beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Fold them into the batter in two additions, using a light hand. The batter should feel airy, not dense.

6. **Bake**

   Pour the batter into the prepared pan, filling it no more than ¾ full. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven to 325°F (165°C) and bake for the remainder (about 50 to 60 minutes more; 65 to 75 minutes total). At around 40 minutes total, loosely tent the loaf with foil if the top is browning faster than the center.

   The loaf is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with only moist crumbs and the top springs back when pressed.

7. **Cool completely**

   Cool the loaf in the pan for 25 to 30 minutes, then turn out and let cool completely. Do not glaze while warm.

8. **Glaze and set**

   Whisk the confectioners' sugar, water, almond extract, and kosher salt until thick and opaque. Spoon the glaze down the center of the cooled loaf and gently encourage it outward. Let it set uncovered at room temperature until matte and crackable.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Carrots

You don't need to peel carrots before grating; just scrub them if they're dirty.

### About the loaf pan conversion

This cake is traditionally baked low and wide. Baking it in a loaf pan increases height and bake time, which is why the two-stage bake (start at 350°F, then reduce to 325°F) and foil tenting matter. Do not rush the bake.

The two-stage bake encourages a domed top. If you don't care about doming and want a perfectly flat loaf, bake at 325°F (165°C) for the full 65 to 75 minutes instead.

### Glaze options (optional paths)

The almond glaze is the most on-theme. If you prefer:

- **Quiet lemon glaze:** Replace the water with 1 Tbsp lemon juice plus ½ Tbsp water.
- **Ultra-neutral bakery glaze:** Use 1½ Tbsp water plus ½ Tsp lemon juice.

All options keep the same sugar and kosher salt. Do not add milk, cream, or butter if you want a hard set.

### Texture and doneness checks

- The crumb should be moist but slice cleanly.
- A slight spring in the center matters more than color.
- Thicker glaze cracks better than thin glaze.

### Storage

- Store wrapped at room temperature for up to 3 days.
- Flavor improves on day 2.
- Freezes well unglazed.

### Critical don'ts

- Do not overfill the pan.
- Do not skip cooling before glazing.
- Do not increase oven temperature to hurry the center.
