recipeIngredient:
  - "1¾ cups (200 g) finely grated carrots"
  - "1 cup (100 g) ground almonds or almond flour"
  - "½ cup (60 g) all-purpose flour"
  - "¾ cup (150 g) sugar"
  - "4 large eggs, separated"
  - "½ cup (120 ml) neutral oil (avocado oil works well)"
  - "1½ Tsp baking powder"
  - "1 Tsp ground cinnamon"
  - "¼ Tsp ground nutmeg"
  - "¼ Tsp fine salt"
  - "Zest of 1 lemon, very finely grated"
  - "1 Tsp vanilla extract"
  - "1 cup (120 g) confectioners' sugar"
  - "1 Tbsp water"
  - "2 to 3 drops almond extract"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Prepare the pan and oven. Heat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a 9×5-inch loaf pan with parchment, leaving overhang on the long sides. Lightly grease any exposed pan."
  - "Mix the yolk base. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and slightly thickened. Whisk in the oil, vanilla, and lemon zest."
  - "Add carrots and dry ingredients. Stir the grated carrots into the yolk mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the ground almonds, flour, baking powder, spices, and salt, then fold into the batter just until combined."
  - "Whip and fold the egg whites. Beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Fold them into the batter in two additions, using a light hand to preserve air."
  - "Bake the loaf. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, filling no more than ¾ full. Bake for 65 to 75 minutes. At about 40 minutes, loosely tent the loaf with foil if the top is browning faster than the center."
  - "Cool completely. When a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with only moist crumbs and the loaf springs back when pressed, remove from the oven. Cool in the pan for 25 to 30 minutes, then turn out and cool completely before glazing."
  - "Make the glaze. Whisk the confectioners' sugar, water, almond extract, and a pinch of salt until thick, opaque, and spoonable."
  - "Glaze and set. Spoon the glaze down the center of the fully cooled loaf and gently encourage it outward. Let the glaze set uncovered at room temperature until matte and crackable."

This is a classic Swiss-style carrot and almond torte, adapted to behave properly in a loaf pan without turning into American carrot cake. It is light, nut-forward, gently spiced, and deliberately restrained. The crack-set almond glaze gives you structure and texture without frosting-level sweetness.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** 9×5-inch loaf pan; parchment paper; mixing bowls; whisk; hand or stand mixer; rubber spatula
- **Oven setting:** 325°F (165°C), center rack
- **Batch size:** one 9×5 loaf

## Ingredients

### Cake batter

- 1¾ cups (200 g) finely grated carrots
- 1 cup (100 g) ground almonds or almond flour
- ½ cup (60 g) all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup (150 g) sugar
- 4 large eggs, separated
- ½ cup (120 ml) neutral oil (avocado oil works well)
- 1½ Tsp baking powder
- 1 Tsp ground cinnamon
- ¼ Tsp ground nutmeg
- ¼ Tsp fine salt
- Zest of 1 lemon, very finely grated
- 1 Tsp vanilla extract

### Sweet almond glaze

- 1 cup (120 g) confectioners' sugar
- 1 Tbsp water
- 2 to 3 drops almond extract
- Pinch of salt

## Method

1. **Prepare the pan and oven**

   Heat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a 9×5-inch loaf pan with parchment, leaving overhang on the long sides for easy removal. Lightly grease any exposed pan.

2. **Build the yolk base**

   In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and slightly thickened. Whisk in the oil, vanilla extract, and lemon zest.

3. **Add carrots and dry ingredients**

   Stir the grated carrots into the yolk mixture. In a separate bowl, mix the ground almonds, flour, baking powder, spices, and salt. Fold the dry ingredients into the batter just until combined.

4. **Whip and fold the egg whites**

   Beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Fold them into the batter in two additions, using a light hand. The batter should feel airy, not dense.

5. **Bake**

   Pour the batter into the prepared pan, filling it no more than ¾ full. Bake for 65 to 75 minutes. At around 40 minutes, loosely tent the loaf with foil if the top is browning faster than the center.

   The loaf is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with only moist crumbs and the top springs back when pressed.

6. **Cool completely**

   Cool the loaf in the pan for 25 to 30 minutes, then turn out and let cool completely. Do not glaze while warm.

7. **Glaze and set**

   Whisk the confectioners' sugar, water, almond extract, and salt until thick and opaque. Spoon the glaze down the center of the cooled loaf and gently encourage it outward. Let it set uncovered at room temperature until matte and crackable.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### About the loaf pan conversion

This cake is traditionally baked low and wide. Baking it in a loaf pan increases height and bake time, which is why the lower oven temperature and foil tenting matter. Do not rush the bake.

### Glaze options (optional paths)

The almond glaze is the most on-theme. If you prefer:

- **Quiet lemon glaze:** Replace the water with 1 Tbsp lemon juice plus ½ Tbsp water.
- **Ultra-neutral bakery glaze:** Use 1½ Tbsp water plus ½ Tsp lemon juice.

All options keep the same sugar and salt. Do not add milk, cream, or butter if you want a hard set.

### Texture and doneness checks

- The crumb should be moist but slice cleanly.
- A slight spring in the center matters more than color.
- Thicker glaze cracks better than thin glaze.

### Storage

- Store wrapped at room temperature for up to 3 days.
- Flavor improves on day 2.
- Freezes well unglazed.

- Do not overfill the pan.
- Do not skip cooling before glazing.
- Do not increase oven temperature to hurry the center.
