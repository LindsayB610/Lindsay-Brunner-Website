Crispy, oven-baked wings inspired by Serious Eats, adapted for same-day cooking with all the food science spelled out so you know why each step exists. This sauce lands firmly in "gentle tangy warmth" territory, not pain.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** wire rack; rimmed baking sheet; large bowl; paper towels; small saucepan; large bowl for tossing
- **Oven setting:** 425°F (220°C) (first bake 45 minutes, second bake 20-25 minutes)
- **Batch size:** 2-3 servings

## Ingredients

### For the wings
- 2 to 2.5 lb chicken wings, split at joints, tips removed
- 1 Tbsp baking powder (aluminum-free)
- 1 Tsp kosher salt

### For the mild Buffalo sauce
- ½ cup Frank's RedHot Original
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 to 2 Tbsp honey, to taste
- 1 Tbsp heavy cream or half-and-half
- Optional: pinch of garlic powder

## Method

1. **Thaw and dry thoroughly**

   Fully thaw the wings, then pat them dry aggressively with paper towels. Do this twice. Surface moisture is the main enemy of crispness.

   Arrange the wings on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and let them sit uncovered at room temp for about 10 to 15 minutes while you prep.

2. **Season with intent**

   In a large bowl, combine the baking powder and salt. Toss the wings until evenly coated.

   Return the wings to the rack in a single layer, skin side up.

3. **Short air-dry in the fridge**

   Refrigerate the wings uncovered for 60 to 90 minutes.

   This step is non-negotiable, but it does not need to be overnight. The fridge acts as a low-humidity environment that pulls moisture off the skin and gives the baking powder time to do its chemistry.

   If you can only spare 45 minutes, do it. More time just raises the crispness ceiling.

4. **Bake**

   Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat to 425°F (220°C).

   Bake wings for 45 minutes without flipping. You are rendering fat and driving off moisture here, not chasing color yet.

   Flip wings, then bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes until deeply golden and blistered.

   If they look pale at the flip, you can add 5 to 10 extra minutes before turning them, or raise the oven temp to 450°F (230°C) for the final stretch.

5. **Make the mild Buffalo sauce**

   While the wings finish, combine Frank's, butter, honey, and cream in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until smooth and fully emulsified. Taste and adjust sweetness as needed. Add garlic powder if using.

   Keep warm. Do not boil.

6. **Sauce and serve**

   Transfer wings to a large bowl, pour sauce over, and toss quickly to coat. Serve immediately.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Baking powder, not baking soda

Baking powder raises the pH of the skin, which improves browning through the Maillard reaction. Baking soda would overshoot the pH and make the wings taste metallic and weird.

### Salt timing matters

Salting early helps the meat season through, but more importantly it draws moisture to the surface. During the fridge rest and early baking, that moisture evaporates instead of steaming the skin.

### The fridge is a dehydrator in disguise

Cold air plus low humidity equals evaporation. Overnight is ideal, but 60 to 90 minutes still removes enough surface water to dramatically improve crispness.

### Why no oil

Chicken wings have plenty of fat. Adding oil traps moisture and interferes with rendering. Let the skin fry in its own fat.

### Why the long first bake

That initial unflipped bake is all about rendering fat before browning. Crisp skin is mostly the absence of water, not the presence of heat.

### Cream in the sauce

Classic Buffalo sauce can feel sharp and aggressive. A little dairy rounds the vinegar bite and softens the heat without muting the Frank's flavor.

### Honey over sugar

Honey adds sweetness and viscosity, helping the sauce cling lightly instead of soaking in.

### Wing sauce swap

Buffalo sauce exists on a flavor spectrum from mild to fear-inducing. A store-bought wing sauce such as Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce can be used instead of building the sauce from scratch. Using a bottled wing sauce means you're trading some control for convenience (it's already emulsified and seasoned). When using bottled sauce, warm it gently before tossing so it clings to the wings instead of cooling them down and making the skin soggy.

### Microwave heating notes

If you don't want to use a saucepan for sauce, you can microwave both mild Buffalo sauce and hot versions (for the Reaper enthusiast) safely. Place your sauce components in a microwave-safe bowl, cover loosely with a dry paper towel to catch splatter, and heat in short bursts (about 15–20 seconds), stirring between each until smooth and just warm. This prevents hot spots and keeps dairy or butter from separating. Steaming capsicum vapors are real (keep your face and hands clear when stirring).

### For the brave

For a higher heat variant (like with a Carolina Reaper hot sauce base), heat your sauce components in a microwave-safe bowl using short bursts (about 15–20 seconds), stirring between each until smooth and just warm. Start with a smaller amount of hot sauce and balance with butter and a touch of sweetener so the heat integrates instead of shocking the palate. Sauce the brave set of wings separately so the mild crowd still gets friendly wings.

### Why this matters (guardrails)

Keeping sauces off heat until after the wings are fully crisp preserves texture. Bottled sauces are often thinner than homemade emulsions, so warming helps them cling without turning crispy skin mushy. When using a microwave, heat in short bursts (15–20 seconds) with a paper towel covering the bowl to minimize splatter and airborne spice vapors.

## Credit where it's due

This recipe is adapted from the Serious Eats method for crispy oven-baked wings, with adjustments for same-day cooking and a milder, Frank's-forward sauce approach.
