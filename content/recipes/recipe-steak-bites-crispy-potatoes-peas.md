recipeIngredient:
  - "1 to 1¼ lb top sirloin, thawed"
  - "1 bag Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien (frozen)"
  - "1 to 1½ cups frozen peas"
  - "Neutral oil (avocado or canola)"
  - "Kosher salt"
  - "Freshly ground black pepper"
  - "2 to 3 Tbsp butter"
  - "1 smashed garlic clove (optional)"
  - "1 to 2 sprigs thyme or 1 small sprig rosemary"
  - "Lemon (optional, for peas)"
  - "Worcestershire sauce (optional, a few drops)"
  - "Fresh parsley (optional, for finishing)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Roast the potatoes. Heat oven to 425°F (220°C). Toss frozen Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien with neutral oil (canola/avocado/olive) and salt. Spread wide on a sheet pan. Roast until fully browned (don't rush). Add small pats of butter (2–3 Tbsp) and allow to melt, about 2 minutes. Toss once, then return to oven for 3–5 minutes to brown and crisp. Leave in the warm oven (turned off) while you finish the steak."
  - "Prep the steak. Cut sirloin into even, bite-size chunks. Pat very dry with paper towels. Salt right before cooking."
  - "Sear the steak bites. Heat a heavy skillet over high heat until properly hot. Add a thin layer of oil. Add steak in a single layer (work in batches if needed). Do not touch for 60 to 90 seconds. Flip once and brown the second side."
  - "Butter and herb baste. Lower heat to medium. Add butter, garlic (if using), and herbs. When butter foams, tilt the pan slightly. Spoon butter over steak for 15 to 30 seconds only. Kill heat and remove steak from the pan. Optional: a few drops of Worcestershire right at the end. Let steak rest briefly."
  - "Cook the peas. Cook frozen peas quickly (microwave or stovetop). Finish with butter and salt. Optional squeeze of lemon. Elite move: spoon a little of the steak butter over the peas."
  - "Serve. Gently toss steak bites with potatoes off heat, or plate separately. Add peas. Finish with black pepper and optional parsley."

Some nights call for a dinner that feels familiar, cooks fast, and doesn't turn into a negotiation with a six-year-old.

On those nights, steak bites, frozen potatoes, and peas get the job done. Cutting the steak into quick-cooking pieces keeps things moving, the potatoes do their thing straight from the freezer, and the peas add something green without complaints. It's a meal everyone recognizes, everyone eats, and no one argues about (exactly what a weeknight dinner should be).

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** sheet pan; heavy skillet (cast iron preferred); oven and stovetop
- **Oven setting:** 425°F (220°C) for roasting potatoes
- **Stove setting:** high heat for searing, then medium for butter baste
- **Batch size:** 3–4 servings

## Ingredients

### Main components
- 1 to 1¼ lb top sirloin, thawed
- 1 bag Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien (frozen)
- 1 to 1½ cups frozen peas
- Neutral oil (avocado or canola)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Butter and herb baste
- 2 to 3 Tbsp butter
- 1 smashed garlic clove (optional)
- 1 to 2 sprigs thyme or 1 small sprig rosemary

### Optional but approved
- Lemon (for peas)
- Worcestershire sauce (a few drops, not a glug)
- Fresh parsley (finish only)

## Method

1. **Roast the potatoes**

   Heat oven to 425°F (220°C). Toss frozen Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien with neutral oil (canola/avocado/olive) and salt. Spread wide on a sheet pan. Roast until fully browned (don't rush).

   Let them get fully browned first. Pale potatoes are undercooked lies. Color is flavor.

   Then add small pats of butter (2–3 Tbsp) and allow to melt, about 2 minutes. Toss once, then return to oven for 3–5 minutes to brown and crisp.

   Leave in the warm oven (turned off) while you finish the steak.

2. **Prep the steak**

   Cut sirloin into even, bite-size chunks. Pat very dry with paper towels. Salt right before cooking.

   Moisture is the enemy of browning. This step is not optional.

3. **Sear the steak bites**

   Heat a heavy skillet over high heat until properly hot. Add a thin layer of oil. Add steak in a single layer (work in batches if needed). Do not touch for 60 to 90 seconds. Flip once and brown the second side.

   At this point, the steak should be mostly cooked and well-crusted.

4. **Butter and herb baste**

   Lower heat to medium. Add butter, garlic (if using), and herbs. When butter foams, tilt the pan slightly. Spoon butter over steak for 15 to 30 seconds only. Kill heat and remove steak from the pan.

   This is a flash baste, not a long soak. Flavor without losing crust is the goal.

   Optional: a few drops of Worcestershire right at the end.

   Let steak rest briefly.

5. **Cook the peas**

   Cook frozen peas quickly (microwave or stovetop). Finish with butter and salt. Optional squeeze of lemon.

   Elite move: spoon a little of the steak butter over the peas.

6. **Bring it together**

   Gently toss steak bites with potatoes off heat, or plate separately. Add peas. Finish with black pepper and optional parsley.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why this works (nerd corner, earnest but brief)

- **Maillard reaction (steak):** requires dry surface plus high heat plus minimal movement
- **Crisp starch (potatoes):** requires space plus oven time
- **Butter baste:** aromatic enrichment after browning, not before
- **Peas:** sweetness plus color plus mercy

Trying to cook all of this in one pan is how good intentions get steamed. We don't do that here.

### Variations (if you feel like it)

- Fried egg on top (brunch energy)
- Swap peas for green beans or asparagus (same logic, different green)
- Add pickles or something acidic on the side (contrast amplified)
