Creamy bacon mac and cheese, built like a restaurant bowl but designed for real kitchens. The sauce is made on the stovetop, folded with crisp bacon and pasta, then briefly broiled to create a browned cheese cap without drying out the inside.

The Velveeta is doing exactly what you hired it to do: keeping the sauce glossy, smooth, and stable. Everything else in the cheese department is flexible. Use exactly what's listed, or use odds and ends you already have. The only non-negotiable is the Velveeta or American-style processed cheese.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** large pot for pasta; large skillet or saucepan; whisk; colander; broiler-safe baking dish
- **Heat:** medium heat for sauce; high broil for finishing
- **Batch size:** about 4 generous bowls
- **Notes:** broiler step is fast. Stay at the oven.

## Ingredients

### Pasta and bacon

- 1 lb medium shells
- 1 package thick-cut bacon (10 to 12 oz)

### Cheese sauce (mix and match encouraged)

- 1½ Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 Tbsp reserved bacon fat (from cooking the bacon)
- 1½ Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1½ cups whole milk
- ⅓ cup heavy cream
- 4 oz Velveeta or American-style processed cheese, cut into small cubes
- 6 oz shredded melting cheese (see Notes)
- ¾ Tsp kosher salt, plus more for the pasta water
- ½ Tsp black pepper
- ⅛ Tsp garlic powder (optional)

### Cheese cap

- ⅓ cup shredded cheese
- 1 Tbsp grated Parmesan (optional)

## Method

1. **Cook the bacon**

   Cook the entire package of bacon until fully rendered and crisp but not brittle. It should snap when bent, not shatter.

   You can do this in a skillet or use a hands-off method like [easy oven bacon](https://lindsaybrunner.com/recipes/2025-12-13/recipe-easy-oven-bacon/). However you cook it, make sure the bacon reaches this level of crispness before using it here.

   Transfer bacon to a paper towel lined plate. Chop what you need for the mac. Any extra bacon is fair game for snacking or topping.

   Carefully pour off most of the bacon fat and reserve 1 Tbsp for the sauce.

2. **Boil the pasta**

   Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it well. Cook the shells 1 minute shy of al dente. Before draining, reserve ½ cup pasta water. Drain and set aside.

3. **Make the roux**

   In a large saucepan (or the bacon skillet, wiped out if needed), melt the butter over medium heat. Add the reserved bacon fat.

   Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes until pale golden and lightly toasted. Do not let it brown.

4. **Thicken the sauce base**

   Slowly whisk in the milk, then the heavy cream. Bring to a gentle simmer, whisking frequently, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 to 5 minutes.

   Stir in the salt, pepper, and garlic powder (if using).

5. **Melt the cheeses**

   Turn the heat to low and remove the pan from the heat.

   Add the cubed Velveeta and stir until fully melted and glossy. Add the shredded cheeses (whatever blend you're using) in small handfuls, stirring until each addition melts before adding the next.

   Taste and adjust seasoning. Bacon and cheese can swing salty.

6. **Combine pasta and bacon**

   Add the drained shells and chopped bacon to the sauce and fold until evenly coated.

   If the mixture is too thick, add reserved pasta water 1 Tbsp at a time until creamy and spoonable, not soupy.

7. **Broil the cheese cap**

   Heat the broiler and position a rack 6 to 8 inches from the element.

   Transfer the mac to a broiler-safe baking dish (an 8×8-inch dish works well) and spread evenly. Top with the shredded cheese and Parmesan, if using.

   Broil until the top is browned in spots and bubbling, 2 to 4 minutes. Watch closely.

   Rest 2 minutes, then portion into bowls and serve.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Cheese flexibility (read this before shopping)

This recipe is written with a specific cheese blend that melts smoothly and tastes balanced. You can follow it exactly, or you can use what you already have.

The only required element is **Velveeta or American-style processed cheese**, which keeps the sauce smooth and stable. Do not skip it unless you are intentionally using the no-Velveeta version below.

For the remaining cheeses:
- Use any good melting cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, fontina, low-moisture mozzarella, Gruyère).
- Avoid very dry or crumbly cheeses as the main component.
- Aim for roughly the same total weight of shredded cheese as written.

Grate your own cheese. Pre-shredded cheese can make the sauce grainy.

### Pasta shape swaps

- **Medium shells:** the most forgiving option. They hold sauce and reheat well.
- **Elbows:** fine, but they absorb more liquid. Cook 2 minutes shy of al dente and plan on adding extra pasta water.
- **Cavatappi:** closest to a pub-style look. Cook 1 minute shy of al dente.

### No Velveeta version

If you want to skip Velveeta entirely, increase the shredded cheese and add a stabilizer:

- Replace Velveeta with 2 oz cream cheese
- Increase total shredded cheese to about 9 oz

Keep the heat low when melting cheese.

### Bacon prep

This recipe assumes the bacon is fully cooked and crisp. If the bacon is still pliable, it will soften further once folded into the sauce.

### Storage and reheat

- Store airtight for up to 3 days.
- Reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of milk, stirring often.
- For a fresh cheese cap, transfer hot mac to a dish, add a pinch of cheese, and broil for 1 to 2 minutes.

- Do not use pre-shredded cheese.
- Do not add cheese while the sauce is boiling.
- Do not skip the 2 minute rest after broiling.
