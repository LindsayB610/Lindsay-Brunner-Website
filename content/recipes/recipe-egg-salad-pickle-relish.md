In my opinion, there are two acceptable ways to make egg salad. The first is the standard method that I've had to adapt to as a Californian: the mayo–mustard–relish route. The second is the Midwest shortcut I employ when I'm back home: Marzetti Slaw Dressing. Both work. Both are good. I prefer Marzetti's, so here's hoping they one day decide to sell their product anywhere near where I live.

Either way you choose, you end up boiling eggs. I let the whites stay in large, irregular chunks. The yolks become sauce. You fold, you stop early, and you do not apologize for texture.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** pot; ice bath; bowl; fork or potato masher
- **Stove setting:** boil water, then cook eggs for 10 minutes
- **Batch size:** about 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 6 large eggs

### Base (choose one)

**Standard base:**
- ⅓ cup mayonnaise
- 3 Tbsp pickle relish
- 2 Tbsp yellow mustard

**Midwest base:**
- ⅓ cup Marzetti Slaw Dressing
- 1 to 2 Tbsp pickle relish
- 1 Tbsp yellow mustard (usually enough)

### Seasoning

- Black pepper to taste

### Celery option (choose one, or skip)

- 1–2 Tbsp finely diced fresh celery
- ½ Tsp celery salt, plus more to taste

## Method

1. **Hard-boil the eggs**

   Let your raw eggs come to room temperature. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the eggs to the boiling water and cook for 10 minutes. Transfer immediately to an ice bath until fully cold. Peel cleanly. Running water helps.

2. **Separate and chop**

   Separate yolks and whites. Chop the whites coarsely. Big, irregular chunks. Set aside.

3. **Make the yolk sauce**

   In a bowl, mash the yolks with your chosen base ingredients, black pepper, and
   - diced celery if using, or
   - celery salt if using
   until smooth and creamy.

   Notes on the Midwest base: Marzetti already brings sweetness, tang, and seasoning. That's why the mustard and relish both get dialed back. Taste before adding more. Let the dressing lead.

4. **Fold and stop early**

   Gently fold the chopped whites into the yolk mixture until just coated. Stop before it turns uniform. Chunk contrast is the point.

5. **Taste and adjust**

   With mayo: it usually wants more mustard or celery character. With Marzetti: it usually wants pepper, not salt.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Why the Marzetti swap works

Marzetti Slaw Dressing is basically mayo that already went to finishing school. It has acid, sweetness, and seasoning built in, which makes egg salad feel instantly nostalgic and very regional. This is church-basement sandwich energy. This is potluck competence.
