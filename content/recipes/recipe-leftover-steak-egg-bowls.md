recipeIngredient:
  - "About 1½ lb cooked steak, ideally picanha, sliced thin against the grain"
  - "4 to 6 eggs, depending on how egg-forward you want the bowl"
  - "1 can black beans, drained and rinsed"
  - "Butter or neutral oil"
  - "Salt and pepper"
  - "A splash of red wine, sherry, or apple cider vinegar"
  - "1 to 2 ripe avocados, diced or sliced"
  - "Salsa you actually like, fresh or jarred"
  - "Tortilla chips, sturdy ones"
  - "Optional: lime wedges, hot sauce, crumbled cotija or feta"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Warm and build the beans. In a separate pan, add the black beans with a splash of water or stock and a pinch of salt. Warm gently, then mash about half the beans with the back of a spoon to create a loose, saucy texture. Take the pan off the heat and stir in a small splash of vinegar. Taste and adjust salt. Set aside until assembly."
  - "Prep the steak. Slice it thin against the grain while it is cold. Cold steak slices cleaner and more evenly, which matters for tenderness on the reheat."
  - "Warm the steak. Heat a skillet over medium. Add a little butter or oil. Add the steak in a single layer and warm it just until heated through. You are not browning it. Pull it from the pan and set aside."
  - "Cook the eggs. In the main skillet, lower the heat slightly. Add a touch more butter or oil if needed. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and cook them slowly, stirring gently, until soft and custardy. The residual beef fat seasons them."
  - "Assemble the bowl. Add the beans first, then steak, then eggs. Top with avocado and salsa. Finish with a squeeze of lime if using. Taste and adjust salt."
  - "Serve with chips. Scoop, do not dip timidly. The bowl is warm and rich; the chips are the crunch and contrast."

Leftovers are fine. But leftovers that become something new are better. Last week we did picanha steaks for dinner. Today that leftover steak is becoming these breakfast-for-dinner bowls that my family always devours.

Beef and eggs are a classic fat-protein pairing. Black beans add structure and bulk so the bowl eats like a real dinner, not just an indulgent scramble. Avocado smooths the edges. Salsa supplies acid and brightness so the whole thing does not drift into beige. Chips give you crunch and a way better delivery system than that boring old fork.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** cutting board; sharp knife; large skillet; small pan or second skillet for beans; bowls for serving
- **Stove setting:** medium for warming steak and beans (in separate pans), then slightly lower for eggs
- **Batch size:** 2–4 bowls (flexible by design)

## Ingredients

Quantities are flexible by design. Adjust steak, eggs, and beans depending on how many you are feeding and how rich you want the bowl.

### Main components

- About 1½ lb cooked steak, sliced thin against the grain
- 4 to 6 eggs, depending on how egg-forward you want the bowl
- 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- Butter or neutral oil
- Salt and pepper
- A splash of red wine, sherry, or apple cider vinegar
- 1 to 2 ripe avocados, diced or sliced
- Salsa you actually like, fresh or jarred
- Tortilla chips, sturdy ones

### Optional but good

- Lime wedges
- Hot sauce
- Crumbled cotija or feta

## Method

1. **Build the beans** (in a separate pan)

   In a small pan or second skillet over medium heat, add the black beans with a splash of water or stock and a pinch of salt. Warm gently. Mash about half the beans with the back of a spoon so you get a mix of whole beans and creamy, saucy ones. Take the pan off the heat and stir in a small splash of vinegar. Taste and adjust salt. Set aside until assembly.

2. **Prep the steak first**

   Slice it thin against the grain while cold. Cold steak slices cleaner and more evenly, which matters for tenderness on the reheat.

3. **Warm, do not re-cook**

   Heat a skillet over medium. Add a little butter or oil. Add the steak in a single layer and warm it just until heated through. You are not browning it. Pull it from the pan and set aside. This protects the doneness.

4. **Eggs in beef fat**

   In the main skillet, lower the heat slightly. Add a touch more butter or oil if needed. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and cook them slowly, stirring gently. You want soft, custardy eggs. The residual beef fat seasons them in a way salt alone cannot.

5. **Assemble your bowls**

   Add the beans first, then steak, then eggs. Top with avocado and salsa. Finish with a squeeze of lime if using. Taste and adjust salt.

6. **Serve with chips**

   Scoop, do not dip timidly. The bowl is warm and rich. The chips are the crunch and contrast.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Beans want acid

Black beans are earthy and starchy. A small splash of vinegar added off heat wakes them up and keeps the bowl from feeling heavy, especially next to eggs and avocado.

### Smash half, not all

Partially smashed beans create a built-in sauce that clings to steak, eggs, and chips. Fully mashed beans turn this into something else.

### Egg texture still matters

Overcooked eggs turn crumbly and fight everything else in the bowl. Soft eggs bind the whole thing together.

### Season in layers

Salt the steak, salt the beans, salt the eggs. Salsa is not responsible for fixing under-seasoning.

### Chip choice is structural

Thin chips will collapse under warm beans and eggs. Choose something thick enough to survive scooping.

### Upgrade paths

A little crumbled cheese adds salt and funk. Hot sauce adds heat. Stop before it turns into a fully loaded bowl situation.

The dairy-free label applies to the base recipe. Use neutral oil instead of butter and skip the optional cheese. Butter or cotija or feta add dairy.
