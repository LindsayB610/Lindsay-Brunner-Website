recipeIngredient:
  - "About 1½ lb cooked steak, ideally picanha, sliced thin against the grain"
  - "4 to 6 eggs, depending on how egg-forward you want the bowl"
  - "Butter or neutral oil"
  - "Salt and pepper"
  - "1 to 2 ripe avocados, diced or sliced"
  - "Salsa you actually like, fresh or jarred"
  - "Tortilla chips, sturdy ones"
  - "Optional: lime wedges, hot sauce, crumbled cotija or feta"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Prep the steak. Slice it thin against the grain while it is cold. Cold steak slices cleaner and more evenly, which matters for tenderness on the reheat."
  - "Warm the steak. Heat a skillet over medium. Add a little butter or oil. Add the steak in a single layer and warm it just until heated through. You are not browning it. Pull it from the pan and set aside."
  - "Cook the eggs. In the same pan, lower the heat slightly. Add a touch more butter if needed. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and cook them slowly, stirring gently, until soft and custardy. The residual beef fat seasons them."
  - "Assemble the bowl. Steak goes in first, then eggs. Top with avocado and salsa. Finish with a squeeze of lime if using. Taste and adjust salt."
  - "Serve with chips. Scoop, do not dip timidly. The bowl is warm and rich; the chips are the crunch and contrast."

Leftovers are fine. But leftover that become something NEW, in my book, are better. Last week we did picanha steaks for dinner. Today that leftover steak is becoming these breakfast-for-dinner bowls that my family always devours.

Beef and eggs are a classic fat-protein pairing. Avocado smooths the edges. Salsa supplies acid and brightness so the whole thing does not drift into beige. Chips give you crunch and a way better delivery system than that boring old fork.

## Snapshot

- **Implements:** cutting board; sharp knife; large skillet; bowls for serving
- **Stove setting:** medium for warming steak, then slightly lower for eggs
- **Batch size:** 2–4 bowls (flexible by design)

## Ingredients

Quantities are flexible by design. Adjust steak and egg amounts depending on how many you are feeding and how egg-forward you want the bowl.

### Main components

- About 1½ lb cooked steak, sliced thin against the grain
- 4 to 6 eggs, depending on how egg-forward you want the bowl
- Butter or neutral oil
- Salt and pepper
- 1 to 2 ripe avocados, diced or sliced
- Salsa you actually like, fresh or jarred
- Tortilla chips, sturdy ones

### Optional but good

- Lime wedges
- Hot sauce
- Crumbled cotija or feta

## Method

1. **Prep the steak first**

   Slice it thin against the grain while cold. Cold steak slices cleaner and more evenly, which matters for tenderness on the reheat.

2. **Warm, do not re-cook**

   Heat a skillet over medium. Add a little butter or oil. Add the steak in a single layer and warm it just until heated through. You are not browning it. Pull it from the pan and set aside. This protects the doneness.

3. **Eggs in beef fat**

   In the same pan, lower the heat slightly. Add a touch more butter if needed. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and cook them slowly, stirring gently. You want soft, custardy eggs. The residual beef fat seasons them in a way salt alone cannot.

4. **Assemble your bowls**

   Steak goes in first, then eggs. Top with avocado and salsa. Finish with a squeeze of lime if using. Taste and adjust salt.

5. **Serve with chips**

   Scoop, do not dip timidly. The bowl is warm and rich. The chips are the crunch and contrast.

## Notes, swaps, and guardrails

### Egg texture matters

Overcooked eggs turn crumbly and fight the steak. Soft eggs act like a sauce and bind everything together.

### Season in layers

Salt the steak lightly, salt the eggs lightly. Do not expect salsa to carry the entire dish.

### Chip choice is structural

Thin chips will collapse under warm eggs. Choose something thick enough to survive contact.

### Upgrade paths

A little crumbled cheese adds salt and funk. Hot sauce adds heat. Stop before it turns into a fully loaded bowl situation.

The dairy-free label applies to the base recipe (use neutral oil instead of butter, skip the optional cheese). Butter or cotija/feta add dairy.
