# About Lindsay

<img src="/images/avatar-color-trans.png" alt="Lindsay Brunner's Headshot" class="headshot-placeholder" style="border-radius: 50%; max-width: 200px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0 0 1.5rem 1.5rem;"/>

Lindsay is a content-and-DevRel hybrid who has spent the last decade translating scary-sounding tech into copy that normal humans—and skeptical CFOs—can trust. She cut her teeth at **Okta**—four whirlwind years that started on folding tables and ended just after the IPO confetti hit the floor. After Okta she wore *both* hats—content lead **and** developer-relations lead—at **Split Software** and later at **ngrok**, proving you can keep engineers engaged without turning docs into doorstops. Somewhere in the middle she also ran all of marketing at the seed-stage startup **Architect**, because sleep is for people with less Wi-Fi.

Today she heads up content at **Builder.io**, where the only rule is "respect the developer's time." That means **content** built for skimmability, launch messaging that actually ships, and the occasional meme if it saves three lines of copy. She partners with product, sales, and DevRel to turn half-baked Slack threads into case studies, guides, and stories that close deals instead of gathering PDF dust—plus she keeps her hands dirty by building odd side projects inside Builder (latest stunt: an AI tool that converts internal videos into **guides** on autopilot).

Lindsay lives in the **San Francisco Bay Area** with her husband **Alex**, their son **Lucas**, and three cats—**Piper, Sophie,** and **Tucker**—who routinely audition for the role of remote-work sabotage specialists. She maintains an industrial-sized stash of sticky notes "just in case," and swears by her custom AI assistant—**GUPPI**—to remind her that lunch is not optional and yes, those pills still matter. If you need someone who can ship fast, make deep tech sound refreshingly human, and slip a dry joke into an enterprise brief without anyone noticing, you've found your person.
