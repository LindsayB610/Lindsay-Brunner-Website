# About Lindsay

<img src="/images/avatar-color-trans.png" alt="Lindsay Brunner's Headshot" class="headshot-placeholder" style="border-radius: 50%; max-width: 200px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0 0 1.5rem 1.5rem;"/>

Lindsay is a content-and-DevRel hybrid who has spent the last decade translating scary-sounding tech into copy that normal humans, and skeptical CFOs, can trust. She cut her teeth at **Stormpath** and then **Okta** itself—a six-year ride that began in a beige San Mateo office park and ended 17 floors up in San Francisco’s Financial District, eye-level with the Salesforce Tower. After Okta she found herself wearing *both* hats: content lead **and** developer-relations lead at **Split Software** and later at **ngrok**, and even ran all of marketing at the seed-stage startup **Architect** (because sleep is for people with less Wi-Fi).

Today she heads up content at **Builder.io**, where the only rule is “respect the developer’s time.” That means **content** built for skimmability, launch messaging that actually ships, and the occasional meme if it saves three lines of copy. She partners with product, marketing, and DevRel to turn half-baked Slack threads into case studies, guides, and stories that close deals instead of gathering PDF dust. Plus, she keeps her hands dirty by building odd side projects using Builder, like this website (latest stunt: an AI tool that converts internal videos into **guides** on autopilot).

Lindsay lives in the **San Francisco Bay Area** with her husband **Alex**, their son **Lucas**, and three cats—**Piper, Sophie,** and **Tucker**—who routinely audition for the role of remote-work sabotage specialists. She maintains an industrial-sized stash of sticky notes “just in case,” and swears by her custom AI assistant—**GUPPI**—to remind her that lunch is not optional and yes, those pills still matter. If you need someone who can ship fast, make deep tech sound refreshingly human, and slip a dry joke into an enterprise brief without anyone noticing, you’ve found your person.
