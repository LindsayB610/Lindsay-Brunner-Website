    <h1>Lindsay Brunner</h1>
    <p>
      Experienced content strategist, developer advocacy leader, and actually
      kinda cool human who transforms complex technology concepts into content
      experiences that developers and technical audiences love. I lead teams
      that build bridges between emerging tech and people and companies who use
      it.

      <h2>How I Earn My Keep</h2>
      <p>
        Herding product, code, and content into one coherent plan‚Äîso you don't have to.

        <h3>üöÄ Leader</h3>
        <p>
          I turn "someone ought to‚Ä¶" into "done‚Äîship it." From chaos to
          process, I rally product, engineering, and go-to-market teams around one flag
          and make sure every action lands with an owner (ideally not me).

        <h3>‚ö° Strategist</h3>
        <p>
          Content, community, or launch plan‚ÄîI start with the outcome and
          reverse-engineer the magic. Data for direction, storytelling for
          traction, and just enough experimentation to scare the legal team
          without triggering an intervention.

        <h3>üí¨ Advocate</h3>
        <p>
          Part hype-squad, part translator. I meet developers where they are,
          hand them resources they actually want to use, then bring their
          uncensored feedback straight back to the roadmap. If the docs don't
          sparkle and the sample app doesn't run, I'm not done.
